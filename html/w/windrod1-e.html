I am studying the duration time of Haste for my Ivory Tower graduation assignment. In the old days, Haste used to last a lot longer than it does now. Indeed, only recently I succeeded in developing Haste with a duration time of one hour. If you wish, I can cast the Haste magic over you. But you must pay me 200 adena for the magic casting ingredients.
