<p>Perhaps it's obvious, but adventurers like you can trade items among yourselves, as commerce is not restricted to merchants only. In order to trade with other adventurers, you will need to stand close enough to hand over the item. Afterwards, try entering <font fg=ffffff>'/trade'</font>. Ah, and do not forget to stand facing the other person.
<br>
<p>Well, if you do as I say, you will see the Trade Window appear. Place the item for trade or the appropriate number of adena in the Trade Window. The other person will do the same with his or her items or adena. If you click OK after placing all the items, the trade will be successful. Both parties need to click <font fg=ffffff>OK</font> for the exchange to go through. If you cancel at any time, the items in the exchange window will each return to their owners, so there is no need for you to worry.
<br>
<p>Lastly, I would like to advise you that the world is not made up of good people only. Always take precautions. I mean, when trading items and adena, the items may resemble the promised goods in appearance only -- on careful observation, the units of adena may be wrong. As long as you do not carelessly or hastily press OK, such misfortunes can be prevented. Don't you agree?
