<br>
<p>Have you seen the Elven Forest? I was born in this cave... and have always lived here.</p>
<p>We are Elves too, you know... but everybody hates us. They think our souls are tainted... I saw it in some book.<br><br>
So why are the Elves living in Elven Forest blessed and we are creatures that are damned? I really hate having been born a Dark Elf. It makes me really, really sad. Boo hoo...</p>
<p>I don't know if it's true or not but, I've heard that Dark Elves of our hometown have instigated yet another war... Oh, they are just so filled with greed!</body>
