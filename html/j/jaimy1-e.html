<p>This neighborhood has a lot of rented pledge houses, not for Aden residents, but for outsiders. It is expensive to purchase and maintain them but they are superior to the ordinary pledge houses in places like Heine and Giran in terms of quantity and size.
<p>I think you can tell just by looking but this is a place where the pledge house district is managed separately.
