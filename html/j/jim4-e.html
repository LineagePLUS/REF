<p>For an eternity it seems I've waited in this miserable place for help!  I kept hoping to be released from my curse by people who have happened upon this place but everyone who has come, until now, mistook this as a secret treasure chamber; they just used their power on me - but didn't listen to me. Of course, this is because I look like a monster. Such an appearance is just the natural consequence of my misdeeds and is not something I can really complain about to anybody... but I feel such despair.
