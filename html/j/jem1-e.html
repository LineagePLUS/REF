<P>What do you think happens when a living being dies?  And is it a living being if, as with zombies, magic gave it its soul?</p>
<P>Ah, but I have not introduced myself. I am Jem the Wizard and I'm studying the magic power that brings life into otherwise dead creatures.</p>
<P>If you are interested in the same field of study, I could certainly use your assistance.</p>
