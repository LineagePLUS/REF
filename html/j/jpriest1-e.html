<p>
<p>Welcome my dear brothers and sisters.
<p>
<p>Just by living in these chaotic times, you have been blessed with the grace of god.
<br>
<p>Being alive means that you have opportunities available to you. Although the current reality may seem bleak, you have the opportunity to save yourself from a dark future. If you can envision the world after this chaotic period, you have the ability to save this world from the chaos following war.
<p>
<p>Dear friends... If you possess a generous heart, and share the joy of being alive with your fellow brothers and sisters, please relay to the families of the fallen, the news of their beloved and give them the medal of dead soldiers. This will allow the bereaved families to pray for their beloved and send them to heaven. Then, we will also give you a small gift.
<p>
<p>Although this is not the type of work that is done directly for god, comforting and giving solace to her beloved children is something Einhasad would want us to do.
<p>
