<p>The magic that I can teach you is only of the simplest kind. Once you leave this place, it will become very difficult to learn magic as easily as you did here. What you need then will be spellbooks. These books have magic recorded so you can teach yourself.
<br>
<p>Magic books are divided mainly into the three categories of <font fg=ffffff>lawful, neutral, and chaotic</font>. And all over the world, there are the <font fg=ffffff>lawful temples</font> dedicated to Einhasad and the <font fg=ffffff>chaotic temples</font> for Grand Cain. You can learn the spellbooks in a location that suits the disposition of the respective book -- and when learning the neutral spellbooks, both temples will do. This piece of information may not be important to you immediately, but remember it and it will definitely come in handy in the future.
