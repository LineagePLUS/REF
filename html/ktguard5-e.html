<p>Since you are not from around here, you wouldn't know... Gludin Town used to bustle with life as a trade harbor, now the only people that wander around are people bearing arms.  In the northern woods, people lost their farmland during the recent war and have now gathered around forming small camps on the burnt-down grounds, living like refugees.
<p>I am not a man of politics, but seeing the sentiments of the people and knowing what goes on around here, I can't help but think that something wrong is going on here...
