<p>Come in. We used to specialize in magical equipment, but I have decided to deal in mundane items since nothing good is coming in these days.<br>
Oh, and if you happen to have any used-up wands, bring them to me and I'll buy them. Usually those things are not rechargeable, but the Ivory Tower at Oren is collecting used wands for their recent magical research into magic recycling.<br>
And if you have any rare magic items used by the Dark Elves, please also bring those to me. I'll buy them off of you.
