Hee, hee, hee... I've lived here for a long time but I can't remember when the last time was that I saw anyone other than a Dark Elf.<br><br>
I don't know how you got here but it would be best for you to leave quickly. It's true that the Dark Elves living here are generally mild-mannered, but some of them will not let outsiders leave here alive.<br><br>
Don't forget that this is the sacred land of assassins.
