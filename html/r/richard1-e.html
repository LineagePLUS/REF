<P>I often think of the time I spent in the Kingdom of Aden long ago.</p>
<P>A festival was held in early autumn each year where you would hear the sound of trumpets blaring from the castle, the rough voices of merchants selling their wares and little kids scurrying about... Now all that is gone, thanks to the Pretender King.</p>
<P>If someone could just... overthrow him, we might be able to recover Aden's former glory... but who would dare challenge his absolute tyranny?</p>
