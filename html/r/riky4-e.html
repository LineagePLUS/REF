<P>I once did something terrible to a friend of mine, Aanon, long ago.  Aanon was a highly skilled master of blacksmithing.  But, the fool that I was, I drew him into the forces of the Pretender King.</p>
<P>At the time, I really had no other choice, my life was in jeopardy.  I’ve never forgiven myself for what I did but I'm trying to make amends for it now.  Aanon and I, along with Gunter, are leading initiatives to fight the evil reign of terror the Pretender King has unleashed on Aden.</p>
<P>I know that some of the black knights still carry around trading documents that they used to trade with Aanon. If you can get one of these old trading documents and take it to Aanon, he will give you something that will be of great value to you as a Knight.</p>
