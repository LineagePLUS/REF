<br>I can't imagine where my brother got such strength!
<br>His magical skills are amazing! I wouldn't be surprised to see him actually raise the dead!
<br>
<br>He's tried to revive my poor dead Elle, but without a body, even he can't do it! I must find a skeleton!
<br>
<br>I fear for my dear brother's health, the magic seems to drain him so!
<br>
<br>My only option is to annul the contract of resurrection and eternal life that's slowing killing him.
<br>Will you help me?
<br>
