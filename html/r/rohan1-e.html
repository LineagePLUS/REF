<p>You are armed -- what business do you have in this town? Ha, ha, ha, I'm sorry. I thought that you were sent by the lord of Kent Castle to keep us in line. My name is Rohan. I'm chief of security here in this village.<br>
This village is despised by not only the orcs of the forest but also by the high-ups at Kent Castle. If the lord is so sensitive to the reduction of his income by the secession of the farmers, you'd think he'd pay some attention to giving 'em less reason to leave.

<p>They are, after all, Humans and thus not as much a threat as <a link="rohan2">orcs</a>.<br>
However, because of the Dark Elven army this time, the villagers of the southern parts have really taken advantage of the situation. Even if it was just thanks to the attempt of the Dark Elven forces to conquer the area, it still makes me feel good to hear about that. Ha, ha, ha.

From what I've heard, an Aden protection force has risen up and is fighting back but that story seems really curious.</body>
