<p>You've heard of the Pretender King, right? Well, that insolent man has finally brought the flames of chaos to us Dark Elves.</p> 
<p>He has joined hands with certain Dark Elves and is using us to bring about ever more confusion to this world. These conspiring Dark Elves are just dim-witted folk who have thrown away their pride as Dark Elves and can't be forgiven for joining with Humans.</p>
<p>I need you to bring me the list of names of the Dark Elves who are collaborating with the Pretender King. Begin your search near the town known to the Humans as Fire Field Town.</p>
