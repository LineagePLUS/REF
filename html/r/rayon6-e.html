When I heard that she'd been locked up in the Elven Forest I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to do something! <br>
I got this ring with the hope that if I gave it to her, she would know how much I love her.<br>
But I have no way to get it to her! I fear that if I tried to see her we would both be killed!<br>
I certainly don't want to make things worse than they are already!
