<P>The first priority in restoring the former glory of Aden, is to kill the Pretender King who is now the current ruler.  </p> 
<P>Of course, those against the Pretender King sometimes succeed in expelling him from the Kingdom but his forces still manage to invade again. It seems impossible to completely get rid of him. There are currently many groups silently forming to fight the Pretender King, in fact I've heard that one such group recovered the Emblem of the Royal Family of the former Kingdom of Aden. However, after that, the Emblem of the Royal Family was broken into two pieces by the Pretender King.</p> 
<P>It is my understanding that one of the two pieces is currently held by Orcs who had joined the Pretender King's forces but were later betrayed. It seems the Orcs are now hiding deep in a dungeon somewhere to escape the searching eye of the Pretender King.</p>
