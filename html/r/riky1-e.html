<P>Are you a Knight in training? You're not one of the Pretender King's spies, are you? Ha, ha, ha...</p>
<P>You remind me of my own youthful days.  As a young lad, I was a Knight brimming with enthusiasm like you.  I thought overflowing zeal would solve all problems.</p>
<P>But now I am a powerless old man...  These days, I am living out the rest of my life trying to cleanse the sins of my past...</p>
<P>I wish I could return to my youth which I spent blinded by desire for wealth and power...</p>
<P>I've always felt like this, but listening to Sir Gerard's words fills me with respect for him and I shed tears of sorrow for my past. I feel the horrible memories of my misdeeds being cleansed one by one. It cannot be compared with the foul gaze of the Pretender King.</p>
