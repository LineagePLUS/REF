<p>Thanks to you, we have learned precise information regarding those shameless ones who have colluded with the Pretender King.</p> 
<p>I hereby give you the order to locate and assassinate the people on the hit list. I'll enchant with you sorcery of the ancient assassin.</p>
<p>When you find the one possessing the Death Covenant, return to me. If you are unable to acquire this covenant after assassinating all of these traitors, return so that I may enchant you once again. I'm sure that we'll locate this Death Covenant, regardless of how many traitors must die.</p>
