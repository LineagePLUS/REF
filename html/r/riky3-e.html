<P>The black knights carry a pledge document with which they prove their absolute loyalty to the Pretender King. That document is highly valuable as it contains the secret missions of the Pretender King's forces. So you see, if we have that document, we can predict and counter the evil actions of the Pretender King’s army.</p>
<P>I ask you, as a noble and worthy Knight, to bring me that document.  If  you do, I will reward you with a valuable relic of my days as a Knight.</p>
<P>The task will be dangerous because the loss of the black knight's pledge document could compromise their plans and put them at a great disadvantage.  They will fight you with all their power to prevent the loss of this document.  Fight bravely, with determination, and glory will be yours.</p>
<P>According to the villagers, the black knights can be seen from time to time in the forest just north of town. I wish you luck.</p>
