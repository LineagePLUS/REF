<p>If you leave Aden and go up past the Scar of Lindvior, you can get to the Twilight Mountains through the Forest of Dawn.
<p>You may already know this, but long ago and according to legend the giants ruled over us with ardent cruelty. The Forest of Dawn is where humans revolted and brought about the final decisive battle in the war with the giants. The giants finally lost to the humans at the end of a long fight and are said to have fled into the mountains. In the end, that location became the dawn of freedom for humanity and the twilight of life for the race of giants.
<p>I don't know if the myth is really true or not but it certainly is a fact that you'll see giants if you go up to the Twilight Mountains.
<p>Of course, these oafish giants are completely different from the intelligent and powerful giants of lore.
<p>
Still, their colossal size and strength are such that even the most competent of adventurers should not dare to even think about going near the Twilight Mountains.
