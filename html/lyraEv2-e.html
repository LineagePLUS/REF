<p>Lyra:</p>


<p>As you can see, my village is a poor one, so we can't pay you much... </p>

<p>The orcs in this forest are ruled by five large tribes: Atuba, Neruga, Rova,
Duda-Mara, and Gandi. Unlike usual orcs, who do not tend to gather in groups,
they have been living as tribes - each worshipping different totems. </p>

<p>I'll give you a bounty for those totems, that are found on some of the orcs
here. I'll give you 200 adena for Atuba, 100 for Neruga, 50 for Rova and
Duda-Mara, and 30 for Gandi. </p>
