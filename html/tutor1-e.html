<p>Hello, <username>.
<BR><BR>

It's always wise to know about about your armor and weapons.
<BR><BR>

First, open your inventory by pressing the Tab key or the bag icon. 
To equip a weapon, just double-click its icon. When you move your Cursor over the weapon's icon in your item window, it will tell you whether it is being used or not. 
Equipping armor works the same way - but take note! Just like getting dressed in the morning, you must put your armor on in order. You can't put on your armor after you put on your cloak, for example.

Certain types of armor may not be available to you. You can get an idea of what items you can wear by visiting the merchant in town. Click on the items in his inventory and if they are only available to certain classes, you'll see those classes listed.
