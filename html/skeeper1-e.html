<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Blue Shark Squad:</p></font> <br> I joined the Blue Shark Squad to become a mercenary because of my village that was turned to ruins in the attack and my precious family and friends that disappeared into those ruins.<br><br>But people of other villages seem to be completely disinterested in the matter. Could it be because this isn't something that happened to them personally? I mean, we are are all people... This really makes me angry.<br><br> I'm just wondering if this terrestrial world where everyone is so selfish will be turned over to the hand of darkness... What a sad thought...
