<p>The blade of your sword can chip when you strike something hard, like a castle gate. And there are monsters that can erode weapons and armor. It would be foolish to confront a stone golem with a sword or spear. Ruining your weapon is, of course, a problem...but you should know that such striking or cutting weapons cannot harm the golem in any meaningful way. Blunt weapons like the morning star or axe are a better choice for such a creature.
