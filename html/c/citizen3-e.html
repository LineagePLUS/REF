<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Luster:</p></font> <br>I heard that the Dark Elven army is really magnificent. Is that true? My heart is really pounding because I'm so curious to see it for myself!<br> The merchant of the weapons shop showed the armor and weapons to me saying that they were really well-made. It is clear to me that the Dark Elves are being supported by Dwarves who have incredible craftsmanship.<br> Hoo, hoo, hoo... Thanks to this, my collection is going to get even bigger!
