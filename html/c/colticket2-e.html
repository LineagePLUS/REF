<p>You become invisible when you use a ticket to watch a fight in the arena. When you're ready to leave, just ask the guard inside the stadium.</p>
<p>However, during the time that you are unseen, your pets behave as if they have no owner - so be careful. I'm warning you because I am tired of all the accidents caused by pet owners' invisibility!</p>
