<p>Here is the current status of castle security.<br>
<br>
Castle inspection before war : <var src="#1"><br><br>
If you tell me to secure the castle before war, I'll hire some Wizards to clear outsiders from the castle right before the siege starts.<br>
But, please remember that it will cost you 100,000 adena to do that. And if there isn't enough in the castle treasury, I won't be able to perform the check.<br>
