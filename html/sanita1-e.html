<p>Recently I went to the east of the village with some others searching for new places to plant fields.<br>Since we had been to every nearby area, we tried to go deeper into the forest... Then suddenly some armed Elves blocked our way and expelled us saying, "This is not a place for Humans to enter."
<p>To tell the truth, when I was a kid, I heard that you could get to the Elven Forest by going to the east from the northern forest but it just seemed like an ancient myth and I never thought that I could really get there. Well, even though I couldn't enter...the trees and the mysterious air of the Elves were... well... very serene... and special.
<br><br>
Later, I heard that there have been cases where people that have gone near the Elven Forest to look for land to farm have not come back. They were lost in the forest... Or something worse.<br><br>
Please go into the forest and find out what happened to the people that vanished. Of course, the guardians of the Elven Forest are really scary but the fairy dust that is used by Elves is supposedly able to put the guardians to sleep.
