<p>Your highness has no need to concern himself with the tedious and detailed particulars of the castle's maintenance since I am taking care of all this. However, you must give direct orders on the maintenance of the castle gates in the event of a war.<br>
<p>The castle has an outer gate and an inner gate. The inner gate refers to the one used to go out of the inner castle that we are in now and the outer gate refers to the one in the outer wall that surrounds this inner castle.
<p>Your highness and your Blood Pledges may order the gatekeeper who stands in front of each gate to open or close the respective gate. But as the opening of the gate is directly linked with castle security, you must be careful to manage your Blood Pledges well.
<p>Opening the outer gate is dangerous because it opens up the inner castle to enemies, but if you always keep it closed, the citizens cannot use the castle facilities such as the blacksmith's shop. Since the facilities in the castle are an important source of the castle's income, if the citizens are not allowed to use the facilities, there will be problems in the treasury. Please consider this when deciding to open or close the castle gates.<br>
<p>Also, the castle gates will inevitably be broken by the attacks of bands trying to infiltrate the castle during battle. If you leave the outer gate unattended, it becomes very dangerous during wartime, so please fix it if at all possible.
<p>However, the broken gate can only be repaired when there is no war, and if a war breaks out during the repairs, you have no choice but to cease repairs. Of course it takes money to repair the castle gates. If the castle gate has been completely destroyed, it could take thousands of adena to repair it. Keeping this in mind, please judge wisely when the castle gates should be repaired.
<p>If you order an automatic repair of the castle gates, they will be repaired automatically when damaged. Of course the cost for the repair will be withdrawn automatically. However, please be aware that this order cannot be carried out during a siege.
