<p>Unlike other castles, Aden Castle does not have outer gates. This is to impress upon all, the superior strength and power of the great kingdom of Aden, as compared to other regions. However, it is also true that the lack of outer gates brings about various additional dangers.<br>
<p>As history reveals, the kingdom of Aden has successfully fought against all kinds of fearless challengers in Aden Castle. Though it doesn't have outer gates, Aden Castle has overcome everything and this is regarded as proof of the ultimate power of the King.
<p>Of course, many difficult situations could possibly arise because of this but if Your Highness is qualified to reign as the sovereign of the entire country, I think you'll be able to deal with this small detail.
