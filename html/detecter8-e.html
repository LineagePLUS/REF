<P>The ancient robe is known to compensate for the physical failings of the ancient Wizards.</p>
<P>Judging from the fact that all of the Wizards of this time preferred the ancient robe, it must have been entirely different from other common robes existing at that time.</p>
<P>Of course, you can experience the actual power only after removing the magical energy the ancient people enchanted the robe with. And in order to unlock that magic, an ancient scroll is necessary. </p>
<P>If you bring me an ancient scroll along with the ancient robe, I will extinguish the magical energy.</p>
