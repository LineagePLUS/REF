<p>Even though you weren't able to save the townspeople who were taken away by the ants, at least you have paid honor to our frustrated town by bringing the Relics of the People. The spellbook and cloak that I handed to you are gifts that were bestowed to me by Duke Digardeng who taught me a lot long ago when I was a Knight. He told me to pass these precious items on to a true Prince - if I were to ever meet one. I entreat you to use them only for good.
