Bring stone->dark stone->brave stone->wise stone->kaiser stone<br>

As the level increases by one, the success rate falls by half. On the other hand, the higher a character's level and WIS value, the higher the success rate will be.<br><br>
To use this magic, click on the applicable mineral after casting the bring stone spell. If successful, it will change to a mineral that is one level higher. If it fails, the respective mineral will disappear.
