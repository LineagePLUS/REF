Perhaps you'd be willing to trade me magic stones that you've refined from bring stones?
<p>
I'm not particularly good at it -- I can barely refine dark stones. So perhaps you'd be so kind as to give me one -- maybe even one of the higher-level ones, like a kaiser stone. In return, I'd give you an item that might be of some, but not much, assistance to you.
