<p>Hello, are you new to Aden? Have you noticed that the closer you get to the castle, the smaller the monsters become?
<p>The guards here are different than in other villages, they have more responsibilities. Our guards, in the capital city of Aden, also have to patrol for monsters in the area around the castle whenever they have time and so it is difficult to find any dangerous monsters around Aden.
<p>Of course, this might just be regarded as a negative aspect by those adventurers who make it their livelihood to hunt...
