<p>Well, yer sword may lose its teeth if ya hit something hard like a castle door with it. There are tales of monsters who can erode your armor or weapons - 'tis brainless, I tell ya, to hit stone golems with a sword or spear. It damages yer weapon, and barely scratches the golem. Much better to hit 'em with blunt weapons like a morning star, or something heavy like an axe.</p>
<p>Ya may want to throw it away after that happens, but if ya bring it to me, I can make it as good as new - ya won't be able to tell the difference.</p>
