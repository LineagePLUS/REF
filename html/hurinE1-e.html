There are several guardian races who protect the forest from monsters and interloping humans. These guardians, <a link="hurinE2">arachnes</a>, <a link="hurinE3">pans</a>, <a link="hurinE4">ents</a>, and <a link="hurinE5">fairies</a>, appear to be normal monsters. They were created by Einhasad to protect the Elves and the Elves' home from Gran Kain. Einhasad created Elves from a leaf of the <a link="hurinE6">World Tree</a>.
<br>
Guardians will protect Elves like yourself but are very aggressive towards all other races, especially humans. They are afraid because the humans' flame-like thirst for conquest may take the forest, upon which they have encroached so far.
<br>
Guardians will also not tolerate Elves who have killed other Elves, humans, or guardians, because that act itself is directly against the will of our creator Einhasad.
<br>
Each of the races have different appearances and habits, but all share one thing in common: if you sprinkle <a link="hurinE7">fairy dust</a> on the ground, they will immediately come to take it.
