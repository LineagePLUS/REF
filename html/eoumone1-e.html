The Elder knows more than any other Oum.
<br>
He even knows things that happened a long time ago. And he's aware of things about you guys.
<br>
In fact, the Elder even spoke of something interesting recently. He said that you are able to help us Oums.
<br>
But he also said that you would change just like the Dark Elves. And so he's really worrying about this.
<br>
I just wish that you would get rid of the Dark Elves and free us Oums who are forced to work so hard.
<br>
And I sure hope that you won't then treat us just like the Dark Elves...
