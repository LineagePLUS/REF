<p>Yes, yes. That is the most important factor. You cannot do anything unless you are able to move around freely.
<br>
<p>As you wish, I will teach you the most basic steps of movement. Press the <font fg=ffffff>Arrow key </font>once or <font fg=ffffff>click the Mouse.</font> See, you can move without any further explanation, can't you? Awfully simple. And if you press the <font fg=ffffff>Shift </font>key and click the mouse where you want to face, you can change direction without moving. 
<br>
<p>Attacking is just as easy as moving around. All you need to do is point at your opponent with your Mouse. When a <font fg=ffffff>sword </font>appears, simply <font fg=ffffff>click the Mouse.</font> Of course, you are not free to attack everything in sight. For example, you cannot attack me, can you?  Well, there is a way, but I do not suggest you try it. If you do attack me, I will hurl you mercilessly down to the cold ground.
