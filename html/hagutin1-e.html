<br>
How are you? You must have come from the land.
I am Blacksmith Hagutin from the Dwarven Castle.
<br>
<br>
I am here studying the ancient weaponry manufacturing techniques of the Dark Elves.
<br>
<br>
I hope that the weapon manufacturing techniques that I am rediscovering will revolutionize the world. At the moment I am working under an agreement with the Dark Elves, but someday I will leave this disgusting hole and enjoy fresh air again. 
<br>
I expect that my efforts will improve the standing of Dwarves everywhere.
<br>
<br>
To fulfill my goal I must complete the terms of the <a link="hagutin7">contract</a> I signed with  the Dark Elves...
<br>
Did you want something?
