<p>Like people, spells have their own natures. Some good spells save people and evil spells do nothing but destroy everything; many spells remain neutral. Wizards have categorized the spells as the good magic of Einhasad and the evil magic of Gran Kain, and call them White Magic and Black Magic respectively.</p>
<p>If you have looked over the list of spells, you know that each level of spells contains both white and black magic together. I'm going to teach you both kinds of spells as best I can... but if you want to learn higher level spells, you will have to receive training at the Lawful Temple for white magic and the Chaotic Temple for black magic.</p>
<p>And as a Knight's sword affects a Knight, so will magic influence the caster. The use of white magic will make you good, while using black magic will make you evil. Black magic has a lot of strong spells, so many Wizards are intruigued by that -- but there's nothing free in this world. Be careful when you use black magic.</body>
