It's so very difficult to handle silver when making weapons because silver is naturally soft and it isn't easily strengthened. But with the right ingredients, that task can be done.
<br>
Make 50 dark stones, 20 brave stones and 1 wise stone and bring them to me with 1 dark edoryu. We'll also need 1 diamond, 10 lumps of iron and 20 hard leathers.
