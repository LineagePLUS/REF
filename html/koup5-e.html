People say that the weapons I make are far superior than the things sold by that simpleminded shopkeeper in the village. Even though the ingredients I require are difficult to get, they are worth the trouble.<br>
Make 100 dark stones and 5 brave stones, using your magic and bring them to me. I'll also need 10 lumps of iron and 10 hard leathers.
