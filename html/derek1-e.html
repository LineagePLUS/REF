To use a bow well, you must have focus more than anything. It's very hard to hit a fast moving target.<br>
It helps of course if you have a powerful bow. Haha... Are you interested in purchasing a bow I've made?<br><br>
If you were to fight with my bow, you'd really be able to go up against even the Dark Elven army that has invaded the southern areas recently.<br>
If you are able to get a bow made by the Dark Elves later, please bring it to me. I'm really interested in the bows that they make.
