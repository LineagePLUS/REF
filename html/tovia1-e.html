<p> Have you ever seen Dark Elves?<br>
The Dark Elves that live in Silent Carvern seem to have no connection to the Dark Elves that started this war. In fact, I personally know a Dark Elf named Ellvienue who lives in the Silent Cavern. Hoo, hoo.<br><br>
She told me that the Dark Elves that live in cavern left their home of Lastabad and went to live in their current location. And the Dark Elven army that came and invaded the south are ones that came straight from Lastabad. Uh, oh.. This is something I shouldn't be speaking about carelessly.</p>
