<p>A war can produce people, like yourself, who have a lust for blood. I'm not so sure you can distinguish who is on our side and who is the enemy.
<p>I'd like to see you fight against the Lastabad army and bring back a badge as proof. By doing so, you'll prove to us that you can tell the difference between friendly forces and the enemy.
