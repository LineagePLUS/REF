<p>I have been Lady Lyra's servant from the time she was born...she was smart and kind and everyone loved her. After she became a Knight at the age of 16, however, she continually clashed with her father Ishmael for various reasons. After Count Gludia was defeated by Ken Rauhel, the conflict became more serious and she eventually left her home.
<p>My heart weeps, seeing her suffering here, but I have always been on Lyra's side...so I don't regret my life now.
