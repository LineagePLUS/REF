I'm not of the Oum race. As an Aden reconnaisance soldier, I was sent to inquire into the state of things here at Diad Fortress.
<br>
The reason I look like an Oum is that I have disguised myself so I can move freely about the fortress.
<br>
The <a link="dfguard5">situation</a> at Diad Fortress is dangerous and you must be particularly careful as you venture around.
