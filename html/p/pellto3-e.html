<p>Even I cannot just cross the lava streams -- it takes a little bit of skill. Well, I suppose there's no harm in telling you since it is no secret. There are places in the lava streams that are narrower than others, and if you use my special hand-made fire extinguishing bomb, the lava will cool and harden temporarily. And so that's how you cross. Other hunters know that I use such a fire extinguishing bomb but there's nothing they can do about it since they don't know how to make one.
