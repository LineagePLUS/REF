Hmm... Are you the one sent by Montes? As I'm not feeling any dark energy from you, you must not be from the  clan of Jejeo of which Montes warned me.
<br>
Montes requested that I wait here for the Aden Knights but this is not a very pleasant activity. Having spent all my valuable time here waiting, I don't really care anymore whether you are or aren't an Aden Knight.
<br>
It's not that I don't believe what Montes has said, and I'm sure the clan of Jejeo does threaten Aden, but the threat to Aden isn't such an important issue here in the Elven Forest. Our problem is that those creeps have taken the water of life. Regardless of whether they are the clan of Jejeo or just the weasels of Jejeo, I'll smash them if I catch them!
<br>
Montes says that you want to help get back the water of life. I wonder if Dupelgenon is up to his tricks again... According to the Arachnes, a creature that looked like Dupelgenon, wearing a black cloak, put a strange spell on the Water of Life and turned it into a bunch of monsters.
<br>
So what are you waiting for? Get going! I'll knock you flat if you don't hurry up and get on the trail!
