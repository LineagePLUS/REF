<p>How to make a fire extinguishing bomb? Well, making the fire extinguishing bombs is no less than the foundation of my business so you can't expect me to tell you that? Surely you jest.
<p>Well, you are not a hunter and I see no serious problem in making you a fire extinguishing bomb but I cannot tell you how to make one. If you really need the fire extinguishing bomb, bring me some ash of Astagio, the main ingredient. If you just bring that I will make an exception and give you a fire extinguishing bomb. Frankly, the other materials are not very expensive and are easy to find -- although you could never make one without knowing what they are. Ha, ha, ha.
