<p>As your highness has said before, there are countless bands outside the walls waiting to seize the castle and take power from you. Your highness has no choice but to tackle the threats of these enemies wisely in order to remain the lord of the castle. 
<p>Once you have the castle in your power, you must first adjust the tax rates so that you can return the castle to a state of security following the damages from war. Furthermore, as soon as there is enough revenue, your highness must repair the inner and outer gates in order to chase away those who bear animosity toward your highness and strengthen the military power within the castle by employing mercenaries.
<p>When you are in control of the castle, you will be challenged by other Blood Pledges. A siege against these Blood Pledges will take place at the time my lord designates. Once you take the castle, please tell me when the next siege will occur. You may freely change the time before half a day has passed since you seized the castle, but the time cannot be changed once this time has passed. If you do not decide on a time for the next siege by the end of the duration given, the siege will be automatically scheduled for approximately ten days later.
<p>Once the siege commences, my lord has until sundown of the same day to defend the castle. Even if you lose the castle, as long as you recapture it before sundown, the castle will remain yours. And once you wage such a battle, you must decide on the time for the next siege.
<br>
<p>When the war begins, it is best to prevent the enemy from entering the outer gate. The outer gate is solid and you can place archers on the wall -- hence it is very advantageous to our troops. However, one cannot always keep the castle gates shut so it is dangerous to assume that the enemy will always come rushing from outside the outer gate. In such an event, there exists a second barrier for our side, the inner gate -- though it is not as strong as the outer gate. 
<p>Furthermore, no one can guarantee that even the inner gate won't be overcome. Therefore, your highness, I would hope that you will always surround yourself with plenty of soldiers as your personal guards. 
<p>Of course the most important reason for losing the castle would be if your highness were to fall into the hands of the enemy and suffer an affliction. But that is not the only condition. If the lord of the enemy Blood Pledge captures your throne, then too will your highness be defeated in the war.
<p>I am being impertinent, but the defeated meets a rueful end. Your highness, please respond wisely.
