This <font fg=ffffff>subterranean waterway </font>is one of the feared places in beautiful Heine. The Temple of Eva prevents the monsters below from coming up. But that also means you can enter the subterranean waterway through Eva's temple. I have heard people talking that there is another way into the subterranean waterway, but I do not know where that would be. Do you even think the rumor is true?
