<p>The fire dragon's lair? Hmm, yes I am familiar with it. It is surely a dangerous place, but thanks to that fact, other people do not even dare to approach it.  How shall I put it?... It's like I've got a monopoly and no matter what I catch, it sells for a good price.
<p>Of course, other hunters do not go near the fire dragon's lair. It's not just that they are afraid of the monster but also because they cannot jump over the streams of lava.
