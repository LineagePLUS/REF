<p>Taxation of the citizens is the right of your highness as well as your duty in order to offer tribute to the king of the entire kingdom, his Royal Highness Ken Rauhel.
<p>Your highness has the right to adjust the tax rates of this region. The tax rate will apply to the Iron Gate Guild and affect all the prices of the goods traded there. 
<p>When your highness decrees a tax rate, it will be effective for the tax collections on the next day. In the event that you change the rate more than one time in a day, the last rate that you set will be applied the next day. 
<p>The day's taxes will be collected and brought to the castle by daybreak of the following day.<br>
<p>All collected taxes belong to your highness. However, you cannot use the tax money as you wish. This is because you must offer tribute to his royal highness the King and pay for maintenance of the territory and castle. <br>
<p>Of course the higher the tax rate, the more plentiful the castle vault, but if the tax rate is too high, prices will rise and the citizens will resent you. Please always keep that in mind as you adjust the tax rates.
