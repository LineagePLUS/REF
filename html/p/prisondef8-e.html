Baranka and Laia are the shame of our race. They must be slain no matter what. We must not be carried away by exultation of our victory, only to be attacked by them again someday. We cannot be complacent!<br>
If only I could break these chains, I would dispatch them myself! Oh how I long to kill those beasts!
