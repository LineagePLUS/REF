I do not think that my appearance here is strange. I joined the resistance to fight against the bad things they were doing, but frankly, I have begun to doubt the war itself. Everybody is wrong. We must ask ourselves, who is benefitting from this war? The answer is easy: Humans, Elves and Dark Elves... As always, the powerful have pulled the strings to manipulate the powerless to do their bidding. The lower classes are always expendable to fatten the pockets of the wealthy. It is as simple as that. This war must end.
