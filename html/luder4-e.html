<p>There are various facilities set up on the Talking Island for the many novice adventurers, such as a training camp. But there are still enough dangers lurking about to threaten the life of a beginner adventurer. So, Lord <font fg=ffffff>Gunter </font>has prepared this place for the safety of rank beginners so that they can take various kinds of training in peace.

All you need to do is be at peace in your mind, sharpen and polish your sword, and learn with friends of similar ability. Ha, ha, ha!
