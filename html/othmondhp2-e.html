<br>
<p>My Lord <var src="#0">, you are the lord of this castle.  I have been in charge of this castle since it was called Gludio; I know it and the lands around better than anyone else.
<p>Even though there have been many lord successions since I became the Chamberlain of this castle, I have always helped in the defense of the castle regardless of who they were.
<p>My loyalty is not restricted to one specific person, but rather to the lord of Gludio Estate. Thus, as long as you are the lord, I'll be always loyal to you.
<p>You can gather taxes and hire mercenaries through me, ruling this province with supreme power. But considering the lives of the people here, please don't overuse your power.  Take good care of the land and people.
<p>Also, please remember that as a lord of this province you can't really leave the world entirely. If you leave this world, your avatar will appear at the exact place you departed, and will accept all wars against you. Your avatar is vulnerable to external dangers, so I advise you to come to the safe place before leaving the world, lest someone tries to kill your avatar while you are absent.
