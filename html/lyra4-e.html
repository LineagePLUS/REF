<p>I mean the war raised by Ken Rauhel against Count Gludia, the lord of this estate. Count Gludia promised his loyalty to the previous king, Duke Dephil, so he was naturally against Ken Rauhel.
<p>This war left a terrible scar everywhere in the Gludio Estate...by the order of Ken Rauhel, they can't even remove the corpses from the fields ruined during the war. But the main problem is the spirit of the people living here -- have you seen those obsessed people around the slime races?
<p>And even in this horrible situation <a link="lyra7">my father</a> is only concerned about his status...
