<p>Have you also heard the rumors that the huge wind dragon <a link="owon2">Lindvior</a> has been seen on occasion?<br>
This is something that may be unfamiliar to young people but to older folks like us, Lindvior is still a name of dread. <br><br>
That's because a long time ago when we first came to this place, the nasty wind dragon gathered up his huge wings like a typhoon and attacked us, turning our village to dust. That's why, no matter how scary Valakas and Antharas are said to be, nothing is as fearful to us as the wind dragon.
