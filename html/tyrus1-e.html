There is a woman I love, but I don't have the courage to admit my feelings to her. What will I do if she rejects me?<br>
It would be great if she loved me too... Isn't there some way I can know her mind? <br><br>
According to my friends, she has a small pet... The pet I'm raising now is one that I'm going to send out to the arena that is to be opened soon. Do you think it would be too much to think she'll be able to compete?<br>
Isn't there anything that would clearly show me how she feels?
