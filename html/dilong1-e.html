<p>Hey! You're the one that Master Gereng told us about, aren't you? Let me warn you about several things before you enter the Undead Dungeon. This dungeon is where the Escaped Undead sought refuge when they were pursued by a powerful Death Knight.  They cast a magical barrier which reduces the magic of a Wizard gradually, with the passage of time, while in the dungeon. You should also know that you cannot enter the dungeon through the magic door if you have any protective devices or items other than the Undead Key and Magic Gem. I don't know the reason for this, it's just what I was told. Also, you must not forget that you cannot find the Escaped Undead after I send you through the magic door if you don't have the Undead Key.
