Foes in Aden come in all different shapes and sizes, from the great dragons like Antharas to the tiny Eidlon.  To aid you in choosing your fights, monster names are highlighted according to their difficulty for your character.</p>
<p><font fg=3300FF>Red Highlighted Names</font> belong to monsters that are much higher in level than your character. Beware attacking these monsters as they will quickly dispatch of your character.</p>
<p><font fg=B5F1FF>Gold Highlighted Names</font> belong to monsters that are slightly higher in level than your character.  Be careful fighting these monsters alone - you may win the fight but you'll likely limp away.</p>
<p><font fg=FF0000>Blue Highlighted Names</font> belong to monsters near or below your level.  These monsters should be a fair fight.</p>
<p><font fg=00FF00>Green Highlighted Names</font> belong to monsters below your level. Easy prey for your battle skills!</p>
