<P>What do you think happens when a living being dies?  And is it a living being if, as with zombies, magic gave it its soul?</p>
<P>Ah, but I have not introduced myself. I am Jem the Wizard and I'm working on bringing magical life into otherwise dead things.</p>
<P>Someday, I hope to make the fruits of my efforts known so that everyone will be able to use them.</p>
