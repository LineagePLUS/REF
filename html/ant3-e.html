<p>You know about the Mutant Ants don't you? I'm really worried  because they threaten our very existence.  They actually eat and carry away those of the same race!!!  Indeed, even the Giant Soldier Ants are said to avoid the Mutant Ants. People living near the desert think that we are the ones doing this treachery. In the past, they would give us grain if we went to town but now they just stab at us with iron spears when we go there... Anyway, those Mutant Ants have got to go if we and the humans are to live with peace of mind.
