<p>Being the first to pick up something discarded on the ground, or gathering an item dropped by a monster when it was killed... isn't it obvious?  Just <font fg=ffffff>click</font> on the dropped item with your Mouse. Simple enough for you? 
<br>
<p>But no matter how many items you pick up, if you cannot use them properly, what's the use?  You can learn to use the items by pressing the <font fg=ffffff>Tab key </font>or using the Menu on the <font fg=ffffff>bottom-right corner of the screen.</font> Select the item you want to use and then <font fg=ffffff>double-click </font>it. Doesn't take a genius to do that. 
<br>
<p>Conversely, if you want to discard an item, <font fg=ffffff>drag </font>it from the Item Window using the Mouse and drop it on the ground to get rid of it. If you want to exchange items with other people or to give to others, bear in mind that you can only do so in the Exchange Window. So, how about it?  Got a present for sweet old me by any chance? Ha, ha, ha!
