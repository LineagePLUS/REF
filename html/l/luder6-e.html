<p>If you talk in your normal voice when saying something, only those people around you can hear the story. Or, if you are whispering, obviously only one person can hear. Conversely, wouldn't you like to speak so everyone can hear you in a much wider range than that for a normal speaking voice?
<br>
<p>In such case, try typing in <font fg=ffffff>![What you wish to say]</font>. What you say will ring loud and clear to persons far away. On the other hand, because you are making a great noise, you'll end up using much strength. Unless your stomach is full from eating meat, you won't have the strength to shout. Understandably, if you keep on shouting, you will get hungry quickly so be careful.
<br>
<p>As you continue your adventures, so many people will be shouting that you could miss the actual information valuable to you. In that case, if you wish to ignore the not so important chatting of other people, enter <font fg=ffffff>/chat off</font> to block those conversations. Conversely, if you wish to pay attention to all the stories being told, don't forget that you can return to the original state by entering <font fg=ffffff>/chat on</font>.
