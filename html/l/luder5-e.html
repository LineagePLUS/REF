<p>You wish to know more about the party system? Let's see if I can shed some light on the subject for you. 
<br>
<p>No matter how strong you are, you cannot brave through all adventures alone. There will be powerful monsters that you can never conquer alone. This is when it is beneficial to join a hunting party. A party is not a mere arrangement of people fighting next to each other. You become comrades sharing an adventure with these people; besides, even for simple hunts, efficacy is greatly enhanced when people cooperate. 
<br>
<p>When you find a trustworthy person, go up to the person, face him/her and type <font fg=ffffff>/invite</font>. You may also choose "Community Options" from the icon menu, click on "Party Options", and then "invite". If they agree, then you and he/she have just formed a party. Since you did the inviting, you will become the party leader and only you can invite other people to join the party. If party members who are not the leader could invite anyone to join, the situation would become too complicated. 
<br>
<p>A leader has the power to banish unnecessary members from the party. Type in <font fg=ffffff>/ban [character's name]</font> and the character is expelled from the party. You may also ban a member of the party through the icon menu bar by choosing "Community Options", click on "Party Options" and then "Ban". You will be prompted to put in the member's name you wish to ban. Of course, a member unhappy with the party can leave on his/her own by typing <font fg=ffffff>/leave party</font> or by choosing "Leave" from the "Party Options" menu.
<br>
<p>A maximum of eight people can form a party. One of the great benefits of joining a party is being able to check each other's constitution and helping each other at all times. The experience won after beating a monster is shared equally among party members. You may have no immediate need for it on this island, but as your adventures become more difficult, you will realize the huge difference between having and lacking trustworthy friends.
