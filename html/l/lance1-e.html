Do you see that blacksmith over there? His name is Darpgadin. He calls himself the world's best blacksmith, but in my opinion, his abilities are nothing special. All he ever seems to make is pickaxes! Why would anyone trust the likes of him to manufacture items? Well, I suppose those idiotic Oums would trust anyone.
