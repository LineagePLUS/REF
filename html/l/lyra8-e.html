<p>Orc tribes are insisting in unison that we are invaders and they are the victims...that's why there are constant skirmishes going on. Even though they won't admit it, they are raising the money by gambling!  I'm sure that those adena are being used for war.
<p>If you are an adventurer, please disrupt the money line between the slime race and the orcish Northern Forest!  I heard that during the night, some orcs carrying bags of adena disappear into the forest. I'd wager that they are transferring the profits from the race to the orcish fortress.
<p>If you get one of them and bring me the <a link="lyra10">totem</a> as evidence, I'll give you one of the treasures from my family.
