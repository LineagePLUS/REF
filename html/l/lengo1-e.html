There is a rumor that some Wizards lived here for training in days of yore, but when I came here with Gunter and the others, there was no one living here -- except, of course, monsters. <br>
Even though there are still plenty of monsters around, it's a lot better than 'twas in the old days! There was definitely some trace of human life when we got here...<br>
Anyway, the effects of the war on the mainland are gradually widening.<br>
Everyone is saying that the forces of Lastabad have subsided a bit because of our counter-attacks but I don't believe that this is the end of the matter.
