<p>People call this the Northern Forest, but it's original name is Black Forest. Perhaps it was so named because of the orc tribes in the forest. People from the Gludio Estate or Oren used to cut the trees in this forest to build houses or make fuel. But, mainly due to good weather, they never inflicted significant damage to the forest itself...but the trees started to dwindle due to the increasing demand for logs during the war...AND people like us who burnt the the forest for planting fields.
<p>I know, I know, it is bad to destroy the forest...but we are doing it only to live.
