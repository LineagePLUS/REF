<p>Come on in! Welcome. Can you see where I am? Move the <font fg=ffffff>Mouse</font> first to find me. If you click on the land surrounding me, you can walk this way. And do not forget that you should <font fg=ffffff>put the cursor on me and click so that a mouth icon appears</font> in order to hear me talking.

<p>Now, go on and try. I have many words of advice to offer you.
