<p>Hello. I am an illusionist dispatched by the Ivory Tower. 
<p>The items I sell are all illusionary and created from dreams. However, even though they are illusions, these items work just like real items.
<p>But be careful. No matter how much an illusion looks real, it is still just an illusion. If you leave the world of Aden, these illusions will disappear right before your eyes.
<p>Also, these illusionary items are like dreams in the sense that they last a short time; five hours to be exact before disappearing as if you've awoken from a dream.
