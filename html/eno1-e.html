<p>Hi! How are you? I am Guardian Eno. We are defending Aden from the Lastabad army.
<p>If you came here to join the mercenary troop, I welcome you!
<p>In Aden, they are recruiting mercenary soldiers who will fight against the Lastabad army. A young man filled with aspiration like yourself would surely qualify.
<p>You can earn a good reputation and reward money to boot. Isn't it a wonderful thing to become a war hero?
<br>
<p>The task that the mercenary troop will have to carry out is very simple: destroy the Lastabad army from underground and bring back a badge as proof.
<p>Depending on the type of badge you bring back, I will pay you with the appropriate compensation.
<p>
