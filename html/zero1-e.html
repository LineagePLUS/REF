<P>Have you come from a faraway land to fight the forces of the Pretender King?  If so, I'd like to pass on a few special points with which you, as a Prince or Princess, must become familiar.</p>
<P>1. Always place honor above wealth.</p>
<P>2. You must value your Blood Pledge members more than yourself</p>
<P>3. Radiate dignity in all actions and refrain from acting frivolously.</p>
<P>4. Understand the significance of kindness and of strength.</p>
<P>5. Be fully prepared to sacrifice your own life to prevent your fellow Blood Pledge members from encountering danger.</p>
<P>Lastly, you must remember that one word from you can lead your Blood Pledge members -- who trust and follow you -- to their deaths or to glory.</p>
