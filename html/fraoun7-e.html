<p>Hmm, the trade with a merchant is certainly the most basic, but that's not the only way to transact. The items that you or other adventurers acquire through hunting boast of great quality that merchants like us cannot normally deal in, yes? So you should know more about such instances.
<br>
<p>Basically, in order to trade with someone else, you should be close enough to receive or give the items. Stand facing the other person and type <font fg=ffffff>'/trade'</font>. The Trade Window will appear on the screen.
<br>
<p>Then drag the item or adena for trade to the Trade window. The other person will put up items in the same manner and you can check each other's items to make sure neither is being cheated in the deal. After both parties place the items properly and click <font fg=ffffff>OK</font>, the switch is made. If you cancel the trade at any point, the items return to their original owners, so there is no need for you to worry.
<br>
<p>One fact you should take caution against is that not everyone will trade honestly. There are some people who will attempt to fool you by slipping in different items -- in particular, an item resembling the one you asked for. Make a habit of checking the items before you click OK to the trade. If you do so, you will be able to prevent misfortunes in advance.
