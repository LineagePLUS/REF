<p>Are you interested in some armor? Well, the armor made from the scales of the dragon, the strongest living creature, is the best.
<p>As you may know, there are four dragons - the fire dragon Valakas, water dragon Fafurion, land dragon Antharas and wind dragon Lindvior. Each dragon's scales are used to make a different armor and you'll need 15 scales from the respective dragon. For example, if you desire fire dragon armor, you must bring 15 scales from Valakas.
<p>Apart from that, the armor requires 1000 Oriharukons, 500 mithril threads and 10 ashes of Astagio. And lastly for fire, 5 highest quality rubies; for water, 5 highest quality emeralds; for land, 5 highest quality diamonds and for wind, 5 highest quality sapphires.
<p>Are you still confident of being able to obtain the dragon armor after hearing how many materials you'll have to find?  I'm not trying to discourage you though, and I'll be glad to make you the armor if you bring me the ingredients. I only ask that you not engage in senseless challenges and become the dragon's next meal. I do not want to feel responsible for your death.
