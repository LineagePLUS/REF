<p>All over the world, there are people like us who can teleport you quickly to other places. Even though we volunteer our services at no cost, on some occasions you will be charged a fee. Anyway, you can move to all corners of the world with their help, or you can use direct teleportation methods to move by yourself.
<p>There is the method of using a Scroll of Escape to go the nearest village, but I would like to explain the <font fg=ffffff>Scroll of Teleportation</font> to you. The Scroll of Teleportation has the same effect as the <font fg=ffffff>Teleport spell</font>. You can move spontaneously to another place. This scroll is a very precious one that could save your life under extremely difficult situations. On the other hand, because you have no idea where you are headed, the scroll does have the disadvantage that it could do you more harm than good.
<p>But if you own a <font fg=ffffff>Ring of Teleport Control</font> or use a <font fg=ffffff>blessed Scroll of Teleportation</font>, then it is a whole different story. Instead of random destinations, you can now move to places you want to go. One thing to remember though is that you must designate a place ahead of time to do so.
<p>Enter <font fg=ffffff>'/bookmark'</font> when you are in a place you think you would like to teleport to some day. Then as long as you do not erase that location from your memory, it will stay within your memory forever to allow you to visit through teleportation. Very convenient, is it not? For example, if you inscribe this very place in your memory, you can always return to us. Of course, you do need a Ring of Teleport Control or a blessed Scroll of Teleportation to do so.
<p>But be careful. When you move to a place in your memory, you need to choose a destination. This procedure may take up valuable time when you are desperate to escape to anywhere and the delay may cost you dearly.
