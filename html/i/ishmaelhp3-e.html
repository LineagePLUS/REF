<p>Taxation is your royal right, and the responsibility of the people living here.  Likewise, it is your responsibility to pay a tribute to Ken Rauhel, the lord of this entire kingdom.
<p>You have the power to adjust the tax of this province. This adjusted tax will be applied to the shops in the village around the castle, and the shops in Gludin Town, thus affecting all trades nearby.
<p>Once you decide the rate of tax, it will be effective the next day. If you change the tax rate several times in a day, the next day's tax rate will be the last one you set.
<p>Gathered taxes will be transferred to the castle around the dawn of the next day.
<p>All the taxes belong to you, my lord. But, I humbly suggest you not use them all -- it costs money to manage the castle and lands, let alone your tribute to the king.
<p>The higher you set the taxes, the more adena will come to the castle treasury. If you raise the tax too high, people will not support you.  Please keep that in mind when you adjust the taxes.
