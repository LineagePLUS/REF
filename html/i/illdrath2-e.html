<p>What would you do if you wanted to go to a far away place, to which it was impossible to walk? Of course, there are no places that are actually "impossible" to walk to in this world, but it's definitely not an easy task. In such cases, you can use the help of teleporters like me. There are people of my kind all over this world; each teleporter specializes in different destinations and usually charges a fee.
<br>
<p>If you use the <font fg=ffffff>Scroll of Teleportation</font> or <font fg=ffffff>Teleport spell</font>, you need not depend on someone else's powers, and can move instantly to other places on your own. The down side is that you cannot travel very far, nor do you know where you will end up as you are simply transported to a random location. This trick may save your life in a desperate situation. But on the other hand, no one can promise that you will not land in an even more dangerous place. The most important thing is to understand the situations in which to use teleportation, and to use it wisely.
<br>
<p>There are a few exceptions. If you own a <font fg=ffffff>Ring of Teleport Control</font>, or if you teleport using a <font fg=ffffff>blessed Scroll of Teleportation</font>, the transfer is not made randomly and you will not land in an unknown place. Instead, you can teleport exactly to a predetermined location of your choice.
<br>
<p>Do you know how to designate the end location of teleportation? What you need to do is enter <font fg=ffffff>'/bookmark'</font> when in locations you think you might want to teleport to. That place will be inscribed in your memory and allow you to return whenever you wish.
<br>
<p>I would like to say one more word of caution, out of elderly anxiety. When you teleport under this method, little time is taken in deciding on the destination. In an emergency, when a split second can make the difference as to whether you will survive or not, it may be better to just escape to anywhere. Do you follow the reasoning behind my advice?
