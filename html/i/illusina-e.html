<p>Hello. I am Illusina, an illusionist dispatched by the Ivory Tower. 
<p>The items I sell are all illusionary; however, even though they are illusions, these items, just like the real things, work best depending on the situation. 
<p>But be careful. No matter how much an illusion looks real, it is still just an illusion. If you try to break from this world, these illusions will disappear right before your eyes.
<p>Also, these illusionary items are like dreams in the sense that they last just a short time. Hmm... I'm thinking they endure about five hours.
