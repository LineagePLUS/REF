<p>Welcome, adventurer. I am the master blacksmith of the Iron Gate, Ivelviin. What brings you here?
<p>It has been a long time since I retired from the blacksmith's work so if you have come to order something, I am sorry but you will have to leave.
<p>However, there is an exception -- the most powerful sword made from Oriharukon and the greatest armor made from the collected scales of dragons. For such objects, it is more than worth firing up this old soul once again before I die. Besides, none of my apprentices has enough experience to handle such objects yet.
