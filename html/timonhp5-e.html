<p>There are already guards to maintain public order within the castle and its territory, but they are there only for the purpose of peacetime security and cannot be mobilized in an actual war. Since you are the one who defeated the Pretender King and rose to the throne as King of Aden, no one knows better than you do that one can never predict when and where ominous happenings will occur. In order to best prevent them, it would be smart to summon Royal Guards, the best of the elite fighters, to keep watch over the area. 
<p>If Your Highness judges that Royal Guards are needed, just tell me how many you desire and I will carry out your command to summon these select fighters. No matter how late in the day you command me, I will gather together the number you've ordered by the same time the following day.<br>
<p>After summoning the Royal Guards, you must decide how many to assign as your guardians and to members of your Blood Pledge. Just give your instructions to Biust, chief of the Royal Guards of <var src="#0">, right over there, and he will deploy them.<br>
<p>Don't forget that all taxes used in summoning and maintaining the Royal Guards are earned from the labor of the citizens and so you should think well before spending this money.
