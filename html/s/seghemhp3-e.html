<p>Long ago, humans were afraid of us and thus didn't dare come into this forest. But some of the losers from your human war started to creep into the forest and burn sections of it. That's when they started to compete against us for food.
<p>What are they thinking? Are they thinking that all the lands are theirs? The forest and mountains around this place were given to us by the Fire God himself. So we fought.
<p>But humans are strong... I can't help but agree. And I know that if this keeps going on, we are the one who will be sorry. The reason we submitted to you was because your desire to rule equaled our sincere hope to expel you human garbage from the sacred place -- even if that means that we have to rely on them ourselves.
<p>...It was possible that we could try to kill as many of you as possible until we are nothing but an extinguished flame. Such is usually our way...but I didn't take that road.
<br>
<p>Nowadays the humans at the burnt field seem to be setting a bounty for the totem of my tribe, and even trying to cut the transfer line between the slime race and our tribe. For both of us, please do your best against these threats, Chief.
