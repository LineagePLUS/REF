<p>In every city in Aden, there are people like me who help people teleport to other locations.  Sometimes, depending on the situation, they will  charge you for their services.  I, however, am doing this at no cost to you.  Through the help of these people, it is possible to move to any part of the world in the blink of an eye.  Let me also tell you about a few more options.
<p>A Scroll of Escape is a sure and safe way to go back to the nearest village, but for now let me tell you about using a Scroll of Teleportation.  This works in the same way as Teleport Magic except that you move to a random location not too far from your current location, in a flash.  When you get yourself into a very dangerous situation, this scroll can be very useful and will probably save your life more than once.  The downside is since you don't know where you will end up, rather than being helped, your situation could become even more precarious.
<p>If, however, you are in possession of a Ring of Teleport Control or use a Blessed Scroll of Teleportation, you have control of where you go.  Rather than being teleported to a random location, you can move to a location of your choice.  But, in this case, it is necessary for you to choose your destination which has been bookmarked beforehand. You'll just click on the location when prompted.
<p>To bookmark a desired location, enter /bookmark [location].  Then, unless you delete it, you can teleport to that place at any time.  It's extremely convenient, don't you think?  For example, if you bookmark this place, you can come back here at any time.  Of course, you will need a Ring of Teleport Control, or Blessed Scroll of Teleportation.
<p>One more word of caution.  When you try to select a place among all the places stored in memory, it can be a bit time consuming and may make things worse especially when you are trying to escape from a dangerous situation.
