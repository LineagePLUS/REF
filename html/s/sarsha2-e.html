<p>Hey, I was a well-known Wizard at the Ivory Tower.
<p>Ask anybody in Giran about me. Better yet, ask Margaret, the food merchant, she'll verify my credentials!
<br>
<p>Let me tell you a little secret. Recently, I've been conducting research on a new type of alchemy.
<p>It is a new concept that combines the techniques of alchemy and those of magic.
<p>This new concept of alchemy will be used to restore nonfunctional enchanted weapons back to their intended state.
<br>
<p>So, if you happen to own an old enchanted weapon that is worn out and cannot be used any more, bring it to me.
<p>In order to restore the original function of an old enchanted weapon, I'll need 100 magic gems, 2 blank scrolls (level 1), 2 blank scrolls (level 2), 2 blank scrolls (level 3), 2 blank scrolls (level 4) and 2 blank scrolls (level 5).
<br>
<p>In fact, the enchanted weapon you're carrying looks pretty old.
