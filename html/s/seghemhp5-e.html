<p>We have our own way of living without your interference. I take no orders for managing the fortress.  I will try to follow your orders for affairs with the main gate, which was made for war time.
<p>You can always open or close the gate by ordering me. Whether you open it or not is none of my business, but it may affect the tribe. Do not close the gate unless absolutely necessary.
<p>We made the gate as sturdy as possible, but it's not invincible. I'll fix the gate if it is damaged, and if so ordered. But it costs adena, and all the money in the world can't fix it during a war or siege.
