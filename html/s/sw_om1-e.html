<p>Do you know what kind of a place Woodbec Village is, my young friend?
<p>There's a large orchard there. It sits at the border between desert and forest, but strangely, grapes won't grow there!
<p>The devil called Beleth lives underground at Windawood Castle, adjacent to Woodbec. That devil summoned the dogs of hell, and has been battling the knights of the castle for ages...
<p>Do you know the secret of the orchard yet? Why won't grapes grow there?
<p>I need to speak with the owner of the orchard... I want to find out his thinking, and decide then whether or not to tell him the truth...
<p>
