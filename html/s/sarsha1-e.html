<p>Hi there, my name is Sarsha. I conduct research with Moria, the alchemist.
<br>
Isn't alchemy a wonderful thing? It has infinite potential for changing the world. With alchemy, you can transform any worthless piece of scrap metal into a precious metal such as gold or silver.
<p>Well, we don't know for sure yet, but it is said that you can even create the water of life.
<br>
<p>Oh! You know what I heard the last time I went to town? Apparently there is this cave, surrounded by ice, that is like a gigantic labyrinth made of countless mirrors.
<p>I didn't have enough time to go see it but as soon as I have an opportunity, I'd like to go.
<br>
<p>So, have you come here to see my master?
<p>If so, I'm sorry but you won't be able to see her today. She's currently out of town.
<p>But... if you came here regarding alchemy related business, I'll be happy to assist you.
<p>Before I learned about alchemy, I studied magic at the Ivory Tower so, I may be able to help you in that regard as well.
<br>
<p>Why are you looking at me with such suspicion?
<p>Is there anything can I help you with?
