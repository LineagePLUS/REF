<p>...Is that so?
<p>According to tribal legends told by our storytellers, the orcs in this forest are made by Paagrio himself, thus making us the closest race to Him.
<p>The beings outside this forest that humans call orc is nothing but a failed experiment Paagrio performed before making us.
<p>The Atuba tribe, whose totem is the Fang of Fire God, is the most glorious tribe of all the tribes. That's why Paagrio let us unite all the tribes of orcs in this forest.
<p>The fact that my task is the will of Fire God is recognized even by the shamans of Duda-Mara tribe.
<p>But now you people have ruined my grand task...
