Those Dwarves over there are wonderful cooks. Their meat is very popular.
<br>
They offered to exchange some of their meat for the purple rocks I brought up from the mines.
<br>
But now I don't have any more rocks, and they say that I must give them adena in exchange for their meat!
<br>
I don't even know what adena are. But I sure want some more of that meat!
