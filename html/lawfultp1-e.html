<p>The one who asks for the power of Einhasad should read the book containing Her testament before the Lawful Temple.
<p>These books are the symbols of Einhasad's power and are kept in the holy god's temple... But the temple has been destroyed and the evil monsters have claimed the testament for their own.
<p>Search for these books. When the long forgotten languages of God echo in this temple, you will claim part of Einhasad's power.
<br>
<p>But beware... If one speaks evil the language, woe shall befall.
