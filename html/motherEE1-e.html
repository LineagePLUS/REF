<p>I'm so happy that you've honed your skills in preparation for the Coming of Age Ceremony as the task to perform is quite difficult. There is an evil Dark Elf Wizard who has come into the Elven Forest and is performing research which is hurting the life of the entire forest - especially the lives of the Elves. This Wizard's name is Darkmar and your task is to get rid of him.
