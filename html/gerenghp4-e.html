<p>Like people, spells have their own nature -- some good, some evil, some neutral. Wizards categorized the good and evil as magic of Einhasad, the Good God, or of Gran Kain, the Evil God, and call them White Magic and Black Magic respectively.</p>
<p>As you probably know if you have studied your magic lists, each level of spells contain both white and black magic. I'm going to teach you both spells as far as I can... but if you want to learn higher level spells, you have to visit the Lawful Temple for white magic, and the Chaotic Temple for black magic.</p>
<p>As the sword of a Knight affects him, magic also can influence the caster.  The use of white magic will make you lawful while using black magic will make you chaotic. Some younger Wizards keep saying that the nature of magic depends on the caster and use the darkest spells without any remorse...but it shall be too late when they realize that their souls are contaminated!
