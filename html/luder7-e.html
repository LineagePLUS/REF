<p>Even if you don't have a lot of acquaintances at the moment, as you continue your adventure, you are certain to make priceless friends with whom you'll want to stay in contact. When you are curious to find out whether such friends are currently in the game, simply enter <font fg=ffffff>/who [friend's name]</font> to solve your dilemma. If your friend is engaged in an adventure somewhere, you are sure to find out. Don't you think this method is a lot wiser than asking in a whisper out of the blue?
<br>
<p>Conversely, you could meet people that you do not ever want to see or hear from again. In this case, to ignore what the person is saying completely, you can type <font fg=ffffff>/block [the other person's ID]</font>. Keep in mind that by typing <font fg=ffffff>/block [the other person's ID]</font> once more, you can undo the block.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, if would be greatly preferable to make more friends than enemies. Instead of meeting people you hate so much as to block them out or people who hate you so much as to block you out, try to make as many friends as you can who are always wondering if you are there or not.
