Lastabad is the capital city, located here in this huge underground space. It was built against the odds, and at great cost to my people. This place is holy to us. If we were ever attacked here, we would defend it to the death. By now the forces of the land have pushed all the way back to Diad Fortress, but my comrades and I are committed to sacrifice our lives protecting this holy place.
