Do you feel the energy flow of the world? If so, what energy do you feel? Is it the coming of peace to Aden with the destruction of the pretender-king Ken Rauhel, who was a huge source of evil power? Do you think that the peace of Aden will last forever just because the pretender-king Ken Rauhel has disappeared? Could it be that Ken Rauhel is in hiding but that another pretender-king force has stepped up to take his place? Do not the people of the kingdom have any interest at all now in the pretender-king Ken Rauhel or the new pretender-king power?

Hmmm... Paying with blood to achieve meaningless results is like scattering handfuls of sand in the wind. Will you just wait around to be given awareness like a foolish person? Or, will you go out and learn the truth on your own? If you have earnestly appealed on your own to obtain meaningful awareness, I'll give you one opportunity to reach this awareness called "righteousness".
