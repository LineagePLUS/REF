<p>The majesty of Aden Castle is so awe inspiring, don't you think?
<p>I mean the sheer size of it is so incredibly larger than other castles... I can look all day and still not get tired of it.
<p>But, if you want to know my personal opinion, the best thing about Aden Castle is the guard towers that protect the area right around the castle.
<p>When I gaze at those towers, that were built to capture the respect of all the citizens of Aden - god of gire Paagrio, goddess of water Eva, god of wind Sayha and finally, God of earth Maphre, my mind feels so relaxed and I'm filled with pride.
