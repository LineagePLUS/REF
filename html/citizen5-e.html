<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Seratti:</p></font> <br>Because of the war, everybody is talking like idiots in hushed voices. I'm really sick of it. They don't even have the courage to step forward and fight! <br>Someone once said that brave men can be found in droves at a bar, even if not one of them will show up at the dentist to get their teeth pulled.<br> No matter how strong the enemy, fighting is the victory of the ancient spirit!<br><br> Yesterday, a drunken guy tried to start a fight with me but when I gave him a good punch to the face, he just put his tail between his legs and ran away. It really seems that you can't find anybody but that kind of cowardly fool around here.
