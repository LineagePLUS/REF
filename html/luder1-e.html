<p>Hmm, you must be a real green hand, asking about that when you could have easily figured it out for yourself. 
<p>The most important movements can be achieved by using the <font fg=ffffff>Arrow keys </font>or <font fg=ffffff>clicking the Mouse.</font> You could just change direction by using the <font fg=ffffff>Shift key, </font>but you should not need to bother yourself with that yet.
<br> 
<p>You probably get the general idea by now. When you want to attack someone, point at them with the Mouse and a <font fg=ffffff>sword </font>will appear. Then <font fg=ffffff>click </font>to attack. Of course, you cannot just go and attack anyone. Sometimes you won't see the sword appear...but even in such cases, there are methods, of course...
