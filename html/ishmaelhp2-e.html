<br>
<p>My lord <var src="#0">, you are the lord of this castle. I have been in charge of this castle from the days when this castle was called Gludio. I know more about this castle and the surrounding lands than anyone else.
<p>There have been many lords succeeding one after another since I became the chamberlain of this castle, but I have always helped them in defending the castle and lands, regardless of who they are.
<p>My loyalty is not restricted to one specific person, but rather I am servant to the lord of Gludio Estate. Thus, as long as you are the lord of this castle, I will always be loyal to you.
<p>You can gather taxes and hire mercenaries through me, and thus rule this province with supreme power. Considering the livelihood of the people here, please don't overuse your power...and take good care of the land and people.
<p>Just in case, please remember that as a lord of this province you can't really leave this world entirely. If you leave this world, your avatar will appear in the exact place you departed, and accept all wars against you. Furthermore, your avatar will be vulnerable to external dangers, so I advise you to come to a safe place before leaving the world -- someone may try to kill your avatar while you are absent.
