<p>Pans are creatures with human torsos and the legs of goats. When Einhasad was creating the Elves, a goat grazing grass near the World Tree was close by, and was imbued with some of the lifeforce Einhasad was imparting to the Elves...thus creating pans.
<br>
They are simple creatures, very violent and hard to approach.  However, you can get horns or manes from a pan and can ask them to make a plate essential to creating various kinds of armor. Their bravery is the best among guardians, so they are one of the most trustworthy beings when the forest is in danger.
<br>
Pans also love music -- in fact, you can calm them with music or song when they are angry. They especially like Narhen's performances; her performance when the moon is full is so famous that everyone in the forest goes to listen. She is quite close to the pans, so if you are interested, you can get more information from her.
