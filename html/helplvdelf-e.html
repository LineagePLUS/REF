<font fg=ffffaf>Dark Elf Start </font>
<p>Dark Elves begin the game in Silent Cavern Village. Unlike the Elven Forest, guardians do not guard the Dark Elves here.<br>
<p>If Dark Elves finish the level 15 quest, they can receive purify stone magic. This magic is used to refine a bring stone into purer forms which are often necessary in magic or to make weapons and other items.<br>
<p>A certain degree of hit points are recovered if you go find NPC Hadesty in Silent Cavern Village and give him a bring stone.<br>
<p>Koup, of Silent Cavern Village, can make various weapons for Dark Elves using various refined bring stones.<br>
<p>NPC Enya, in Silent Cavern Village, teleports novices to Hidden Valley, an area dedicated to teaching newbies about the world of Lineage. Only characters of level 12 or less can be transported to Hidden Valley. Once you attain level 13, you will be automatically ejected from Hidden Valley.<br>
<p>There is an NPC in the middle of Hidden Valley Village who can enchant your character -- at no cost! -- with haste magic, which will make you move faster. There are also healers in various places of the village that recover HP.<br>
<p>If you exit Hidden Valley Village and go find the training dummies, you can safely level-up to level 5. <br>
