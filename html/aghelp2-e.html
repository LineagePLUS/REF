<p> A Pledge house is originally owned by the Prince or Princess of the area, so you must pay <font fg=ffffff>taxes</font> regularly to the ruling land owner in order to continue using the Pledge house. <BR> The first tax notice will come to you ten days after purchasing a Pledge house. After receiving the tax notice, use the <font fg=ffffff>Pay Taxes</font> command to pay the amount written on the notice. <BR> The tax notice comes once every ten days. If you don't pay the tax before the stated date, a single reminder letter is sent. If you still don't pay the tax by the date stated on the reminder letter, the Prince or Princess will take ownership of the house away from you and auction it off.  So, be careful not to forget to pay the tax. <BR> All notices are delivered as letters by doves. <BR>
