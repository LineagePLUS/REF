<p>Hmm, are you saying that you still do not know how to do that? Whew, I guess I have no choice. Listen up now and I will teach you how to buy and sell goods.
<br>
<p>The first necessary step would be to say whether you are planning on buying or selling an item, OK? Depending on what you want to do, press either the <font fg=ffffff>Buy</font> or <font fg=ffffff>Sell</font> buttons. Then you will see a detailed list of items available for purchase at the store, or a list of the items you can sell.
<br>
<p>Next, find the item you want to buy or sell and click on the arrow in the lower-right corner to decide on the quantity. You can purchase or sell many items at once, so this method will probably prove to be convenient for you. Be sure to refer to the total price that will appear each time you adjust the quantity. There's nothing difficult about the process. Do it once and you will get the hang of it.
<br>
<p>Remember, depending on the region and merchant, the goods that are sold or bought may differ. There may be times when the same goods are sold or bought at different prices. If you take all of these facts into consideration in advance, you will not have to wander all over the place to sell an item you acquired by beating a monster. Understood?
