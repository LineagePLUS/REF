<p>Dear, dear! You still do not know the simplest fact. When you meet a merchant like me, click on the <font fg=ffffff>Buy</font> or <font fg=ffffff>Sell</font> button, depending on whether you have an item you wish to buy or to sell.
<br>
<p>Then you will see the list of items you can buy or sell organized neatly on your left. As you take a look at this list, find the item you want and choose the quantity of the item using the arrows. This method is very convenient when you are selling or buying a number of things at once. It is very nice that the amount of money to be exchanged for that quantity of items is shown on the very bottom for reference. And when you are done choosing, click on the <font fg=ffffff>button in the lower right</font>. Simple enough, isn't it?
<br>
<p>All the merchants deal in different goods. The types of goods differ of course, and in some cases, even the prices can vary for the same items. Keep this fact in mind if you want to save money. Similarly, the items that the merchants purchase from you also differ. For certain items, you need to go see a specific merchant in order to make your sale.
