<p>I, the one who came to this gloomy darkness, following Antharas the earth dragon... the one who fought against the fathomless horror at the risk of my life... the one whose body is engulfed by the dark breath of Antharas, but whose soul is bound in the sword... I am waiting for the true hero who will follow my will.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have the courage to face the evil earth dragon Antharas, accept my challenge. If you can prove that you are a true hero, I'll give you <a link="cray10">Dragon Slayer</a>, the one and only sword that can face the mighty dragon.</p>
<br>
<a action="craytrial">Accept Cray's quest.</a>
