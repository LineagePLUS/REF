<p>Do you mean you want to go to the Forgotten Island?</p>
<p>Sorry, but I have no intention of selling you a boat ticket.  As I have already said, that is a truly frightening place. The way I see it, selling a ticket to someone certain to die a cruel death is tantamount to murder.</p>
<p>If you're still intent on going, do not plead with me now but come back after you have honed your skills a bit more.</p>
