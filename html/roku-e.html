<p>Are you trying to go up to - and maybe even past - level four?
<p>If so, please be extra careful. I don't know if anyone told you here on the first level, but the areas at level four and above are much more dangerous than the lower levels. Magical creatures that were let loose during magical experiments roam all over the place.
<p>The area is not forbidden to you, but I cannot stress enough the importance of preparing for all possible contingencies.
<p>And level six is different from four and five -- even more dangerous magical creatures inhabit the sixth level and above.
<p>The monsters there are only bound to the place by the force of the Ivory Tower. They were originally from the evil world and are in a class that is entirely different from those of the fourth and fifth levels.
<p>If you are still determined to climb higher, do take my advice and watch out.
