<p>Even though I might not look like much, I am an apprentice of the great Wizard Hardin.  Unfortunately, I never fully completed my training under my master before he left....</p>
<p>He left here several years ago, saying that an old pledge required him to protect his lord's son.</p>
<br>
<p>...I felt quite lonely after he left, but it is all right - I was an orphan, so I'm used to it. Furthermore, I have things to distract me such as guests like you visiting me from time to time.</p>
