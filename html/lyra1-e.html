<p>Welcome. Are you an adventurer? Or a mercenary? In any case, welcome to Fire-field Farmers Town. I'm the representative of this village, Lyra Gregheim. You may call me Lyra.
<p>As you can see, the village is just getting by with the <a link="lyra2">burnt fields</a> but this is a good place to live.
<p>If only there were no <a link="lyra3">threat from the orcs</a>, I mean.
