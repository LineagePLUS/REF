<p>I'm providing you with my followers only because there is a common profit. They will 'cooperate', but won't give their hearts.
<p>All of our orcs have a talent as warriors, but we don't have any concept of an army -- except for the Neruga tribe. So if you want to use the warriors of my tribe, you have to employ them. I'll process the details once so ordered.
<p>Archers for the tower will be assigned as soon as they are picked. But for other warriors, you should let me know how many of them I should assign to your pledge members.
<p>...If your members talk to Kent Neruga, the warrior among warriors, he will give them the assigned warriors.
