<p>As you can see, this is just a humble fishing town. Due to the sea currents here, there are actually not many fish to be found, so we have taken up farming as well. And now that a war has broken out, it has become really difficult to live here...<br>
Still... The vast sea horizon and blue sea can soothe the deepest depressions.<br> Have you ever seen a <a link="deker2">whale</a>? It's a fish even bigger than the ents in the Elven Forest! Sometimes seeing one of them surface and spraying water makes me shiver just to think of it...ahhh.</p>
