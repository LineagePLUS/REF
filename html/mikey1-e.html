<p>This is really a large and confusing city, one often ends up wandering around in circles when trying to go home.
<p>Once before, I took the wrong path and ended up in a place called the Slum District and that was extremely scary. There were many frightful men with strange scars on their bodies and all the houses looked like they were about to collapse... Fortunately, I was able to find the right road and make my way back home...
<p>But I certainly don't want to go there again.
