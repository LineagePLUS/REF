<p>As far as I know there are five orc tribes of varied size in this forest. The first is Seghem's Atuba tribe, which is the leader of the tribes...and then there's Neruga, the battle tribe where every orc is a warrior from birth.  Next comes Rova, which depends on Atuba; then there's the mysterious Duda-Mara which is rumored to have shamans within it. Finally, the weakling Gandi tribe, which is suffering under Atuba rule.
<p>According to the book I read, there are other, smaller tribes here. Especially the shameless <a link="lyra9">Agni tribe</a> which is making money by inciting gambling activity -- they're quite famous around here.
