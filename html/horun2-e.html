<p>Among the <a link="horun4">guardians</a> of the forest, I like ents the most.</p>
<p>They are the most reticent of all the creations of Einhasad, but they are probably the most learned. After all, they are direct descendants of the <a link="horun5">World Tree</a>.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>It's not just because you can get <a link="horun6">a twig or bark</a> from them.</p>
<br>
<p>...Come to think of it, <a link="horun3">my master</a> was very close with the ents.</p>
