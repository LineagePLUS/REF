<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Adventurer Raidar:</p></font> <br>OK, what I need is a plate called tear of moonlight that is made of shining scales of Ramia. It is a metal plate that just looks ordinary to normal people and that looks partly like metal and partly like mineral.<br> An alchemist can refine it but a long time ago, a girl named Ryumiel in Aden, refined one of those plates for me too. If you get any shining scales, go find that girl.<br> Oh, and I'll need 20 of those tears of moonlight. If you will bring me 20 tears of moonlight, I will give you fruit of evolution. May your future travels be showered with blessings.<br><br>
