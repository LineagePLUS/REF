<p>You may be a novice adventurer as of yet, but if you continue to add experience, you'll mature into an excellent adventurer.  In no time at all you will be able to make numerous friends. When you meet others that you enjoy playing with, you may find yourself wondering if they're in the game (where they are) and what they're doing.
<br>
<p>In such cases, type in <font fg=ffffff>/who [friend's name]</font> to answer your curiosity instantly. If your friend is venturing out in a different terrain, you will be notified of this information immediately. The steps afterwards are self-explanatory. You use the whispering mode to meet your friend and enjoy the adventure together again.
<br>
<p>But do not think that you will befriend everyone in the world.  You may win some great friends but, on the other hand, you may encounter a few pests that you never want to meet again. If you want to ignore what a player is saying, type <font fg=ffffff>/block [the other person's ID]</font> to block out whatever the person is saying from your ears. If you type in <font fg=ffffff>/block [the other person's ID]</font> once more, you will be able to hear him/her again.
