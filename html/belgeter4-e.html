<p>Hmm, you wish to know more about the <font fg=ffffff>Hidden Valley, </font>huh? Well, simply put, the Valley is a place for training novice Knights.
<br>
<p>Of course, the Silver Knight's village functions in the same manner, but I must warn you -- that village may hold dangers for shy beginners. So, this is the place created to protect the likes of you from unnecessary danger, and to see you through an effective training course.
<p>No monsters with extreme powers, murderous maniacs, or experienced adventurers who could interrupt your training are allowed to enter. You will never meet a murderer, a huge monster that you are not competent to face, or any adventurer who does not need the Valley's training. You can take your time and concentrate on improving your own abilities.
<br>
<p>But there is just one thing you must keep in mind. The time will come when further training at this place becomes useless as you develop your potential and surpass the Valley's training capability. The Valley cannot be your nest forever. Someday you must fly high and far...
