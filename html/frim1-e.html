The feeling of having one's magic blocked by something... An unknown feeling where one's strength just continuously falls.
<br>
I can't define it for you precisely but this feeling of a dark and powerful energy seems like it might actually be the power of black mithril.
<br>
<br>
As one who carries black mithril ore around every day, what feeling does it give you?
<br>
Could it be... that you feel the same thing that I do?
<br>
<br>
Hmm... Well anyway, it will likely take a long time to reveal the properties of this mineral.
<br>
In order to do that, I've got to get started on the work that I promised to do.
<br>
You can set down here the <a link="frim3">black mithril ore</a> that you brought from the Oums.
