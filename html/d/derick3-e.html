<font fg=ffffff>Lake Laina</font> is in a different direction from Lake Louis. You will see Lake Laina if you continue going in the direction of Windawood. It is very small compared to Lake Louis, but along with the <font fg=ffffff>Forest of Mirrors</font>, the lake plays a key role in acting as a natural fortress for us at Heine. If you cross Lake Laina, Heine Castle is just a very short distance away.
