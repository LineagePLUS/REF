<P>Knights from long ago times probably wore the ancient plate mail to give their bodies extra protection from the monsters.</p>
<P>I heard that, unlike today, there was no method in ancient times of strengthening a suit of armor by using a scroll of enchant armor. Therefore, the ancient plate mail was made extremely tough and enduring.</p>
<P>Of course, you can experience the actual power only after removing the magical energy the ancient people enchanted the plate mail with. And in order to unlock that magic, an ancient scroll is necessary. </p>
<P>If you bring me an ancient scroll along with the ancient plate mail, I will extinguish the magical energy.</p>
