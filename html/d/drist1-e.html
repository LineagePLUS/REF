<p>In my opinion, you already have adequate abilities. I don't think there is any need for you to return to the Valley. Overly rigorous training can ruin your body and exceedingly easy training with no challenges will do you no good either. Believe in yourself a bit more. The Hidden Valley is not a place for someone as experienced as you. OK? <br>
