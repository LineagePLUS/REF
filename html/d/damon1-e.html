<p> Have you ever thought about the disposition of your leader? Mustn't a ruler who leads a Blood Pledge know how to sacrifice for others, take care of the weak and act fairly? It doesn't seem like I've met anyone like that recently. One should not run around stealing things from others, forming gangs, bullying the weak and busying oneself with gaining power and property through sordid acts. Ah... is there no one who will show the true face of a ruler? </p>
