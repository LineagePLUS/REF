Currently, the Blood Pledges of Aden -- led by the pledge here at Diad Fortress -- are doing battle with the Dark Elves of Lastabad.<br>
Because of that, no one can be guaranteed of safety here.
<br>
<br>
If you do not yet belong to a Blood Pledge, how about joining one and contributing your energies to the defeat of the Dark Elves?
