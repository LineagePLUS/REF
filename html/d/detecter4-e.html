<P>The ancient sword is also believed to have been used by the ancient people.  The potential of the Ancient great sword is nearly limitless but its immense size makes it mandatory that you carry the sword using both hands. In comparison, the ancient sword is light enough to freely swing it around in one hand.</p>
<P>Since no one has ever witnessed a duel of strength between a person wielding an ancient great sword and a person fighting with an ancient sword, it would be difficult to say which is the more powerful of the two -- but it is certain that both are very mighty swords.</p>
<P>Of course, you can experience the actual power only after removing the magical energy the ancient people enchanted the sword with. And in order to unlock that magic, an sncient dcroll is necessary. </p>
<P>If you bring me an ancient scroll along with the ancient sword, I will extinguish the magical energy.
