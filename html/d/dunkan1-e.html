<p>I've heard that the lord has changed again. Even though we are not in a position to discuss the doings of our betters, the tax seems to increase every time the lord changes... <br><br>
And we've been invaded by the Dark Elven army and Gludin Village has been turned into a barren area. The taxes went up yet again because of the war.<br>
Sheesh... Whether it's because of the war or some other reason, it's just really hard to live.
