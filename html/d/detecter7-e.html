<P>The ancient leather armor was most likely used by the ancient Elves for physical protection against various monsters.</p>
<P>It is known that the Elves made this armor a long, long time ago. And according to Ellyonne, it is not Nerupa's work.</p>
<P>Of course, you can experience the actual power only after removing the magical energy the ancient people enchanted the leather armor with. In order to unlock that magic, an ancient scroll is necessary. </p>
<P>If you bring me an ancient scroll along with the ancient leather armor, I will extinguish the magical energy.</p>
