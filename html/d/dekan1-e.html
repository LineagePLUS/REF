<p>On your way to the capital city of Aden, located in the south, you will see a rather wide expanse of wasteland where the snow landscape ends. 
<p>Ages ago, there was a great battle at that location during the invasion by Elmore. The war eventually ended after both sides suffered uncountable losses, but the ghosts of the dead Elmore soldiers -- whose corpses were never recovered -- still remain bound within the land.
<p>I don't know if it's because they wish to return to their homelands, or whether they are cursing the Aden they fought, but be sure to take full precautions when you pass by.
<p>If you come under attack, you might be able to seek help if you are close to the <a link="dekan2">border camp</a>.
