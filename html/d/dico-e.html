<p>This is something I remind myself of all the time... General Lazulos is a person worthy of respect. To be honest, there is not one merchant who wishes to do business in such a lonely border camp in the middle of the wilderness.
<p>If it weren't for General Lazulos, I would have no desire to come all the way out here, shuddering in the cold to do business. But whenever I see the general, I think to myself that I wish I could be of some help to him.
<p>So please cooperate here. Isn't it difficult enough just to return to the town?
