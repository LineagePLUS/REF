<p>This town was formed from association with the Iron Gate Guild. Surely you too can't be unfamiliar with this guild? More than anything, it is the greatest distribution guild in the entire Aden region. <br><br>
They have a monopoly in the area of items from Aden but thanks to that, the prices of the items are cheap. I'm worried that prices may increase because of the war that has broken out in Gludio.
