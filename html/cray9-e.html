<P>Ah, wonderful! You truly deserve a hero's honor. But the one and only sword that can slay the dragon is the Dragon Slayer.  Only those with mighty strength can wield this sword. It's really a shame I can't give it to you.</p>
<br>
<p>Instead, I'll give you this <font fg=ffffff>Damascus sword</font> to reward your valor. May it serve to make your name known.</p>
