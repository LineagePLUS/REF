<p> Well... It's a fairly well-known legend among Wizards of the continent that this island has long been a training ground for young magi...but legend can veer from reality.  I was the only one who studied magic here for the last ten years - and even I didn't come here to study! I just came to help Gunter, who wanted to make a proving ground for young Knights.
<br>
<p> According to Gunter, this island had nothing but monsters - and lots of 'em - on it when he and Hardin first arrived.  No Wizards were to be found.
<br>
<p> It's quite odd that there was no one living here before Gunter built his training ground...perhaps Hardin knows what happened before.
