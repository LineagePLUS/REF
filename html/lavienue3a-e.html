This is a small and quiet village and so it's not so easy for me to find ingredients for my research.<br>
If you will get me the following items, I will give you a scroll of healing.
<br><br>

Heart of Firebird<br>
Heart of Ice Queen<br>
Heart of Golem<br>
Heart of Drake<br><br>

The four hearts represent crystals of the four elements and you can have Ryumiel make the pieces of crystal by going to see her in Aden.<br>
For your reference, she is a pupil of mine that I love. Like me, she's pretty capable at what she does.<br><br>
