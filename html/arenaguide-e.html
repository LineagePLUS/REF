<br>
<p>Please take a look at the bottom right side of the screen. If you look in that direction, you can find out what type of region you are in at present. There are four region types: <font fg=ffffff>Safe Zone</font>, <font fg=ffffff>Normal Zone</font>, <font fg=ffffff>Combat Zone</font>, and lastly, <font fg=ffffff>Free Player Killer (PK) Zone</font>.
<br>
<p>I will explain each of the regions. First, the <font fg=ffffff>Safe Zone</font> is literally a safe area, such as the place we are in now. Adventurers are not allowed to attack each other; only monsters can fight as opponents. The Safe Zone is especially helpful to the less experienced adventurers. But keep in mind that once you go outside, only certain areas like villages are Safe Zones.
<br>
<p>Next is the <font fg=ffffff>Normal Zone.</font> Almost all of the land mass in Giran is composed of Normal Zones. Monsters and adventurers can attack each other, and lives can be lost. However, such outrageous acts of evil do not go unnoticed and the security guards strike murderers, causing them to fall deeper and deeper into evil. Of course, the fallen adventurers face problems too, as they may lose experience and items.
<br>
<p>The third is the <font fg=ffffff>Combat Zone</font>. Narrow alleyways or front yards of homes would be examples of Combat Zones. Attacks upon each other are possible but there are no special measures to keep either party of the fight in check. No security guards will kick you out for attacking, nor will you lose any items or experience when you fall.
<br>
<p>Last, there is the <font fg=ffffff>Free PK Zone</font>. Consider this zone to be an area where players challenge each other's abilities. Like the Combat Zone, attackers will not be punished at all for knocking over opponents. On the other hand, players who lose will face the same disadvantages as in a Normal Zone. Hmm, shall we say that the concept of "survival of the fittest" is practiced here?
<br>
<p>The place you are in now is a Safe Zone, but once you go outside, such safe areas are practically non-existent. Bear this in mind and take care to protect yourself.
