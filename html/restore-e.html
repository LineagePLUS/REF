<p>In the name of the benevolence of Einhasad, I have been called here to bestow blessings to the suffering.</p>
<p>I can restore about half of the experience you've lost most recently. However - and for this is I am truly sorry - I'll need a certain amount of adena for reasons I can not divulge. The amount of adena needed depends on how strong you are.</p>
<p>If you are a person who is significantly stronger than other people, the amount of experience you've lost and which needs to be restored is comparatively more. Also, if you have not followed the teachings of the light of Einhasad and chased after Gran Kain, then the required amount is more. On the other hand, if you are faithfully following the teachings of light, then the amount becomes less.</p>
<p>The thing you have to be most careful about is that, even though you've lost experience multiple times during extreme adversity, the portion that I can restore to you is just the part that was lost most recently and even of that portion, only about half.</p>
<p>... May the blessings of Einhasad be with you...</p>
