<P>Some very shady characters sometime gather in Fire-Field Farmer's Town.</p>
<P>Are you one of them? Or have you come to destroy the orcs who invade the peaceful Elven Forest?</p>
<P>Have you heard the orcs speak? It is impossible to understand them, they use such crude words.</p>
<P>When you come across orcs in your journey, it would be best to either attack first or run away.</p>
