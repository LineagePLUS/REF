<p>May the holy purification water reach all parts of your body and deep into your heart...</p>
<p>I am Priest Eveurol in charge of <a link="eveurol2">Eva's Temple</a> here. If you are the courageous adventurer who will protect Heine from the water dragon Fafurion and its polluted children of the water, then I will give you <font fg=ffffff>Eva's Blessing</font> for a donation of 300 adena. Drink this and you will be able to breathe underwater.<br>
<p>You can go down the <a link="eveurol3">subterranean waterway</a> through this entrance. Proceed along and you will reach the <a link="eveurol4">ruins of the lake bottom</a>. Located at one corner of the ruins is the cave where the water dragon Fafurion is hiding. Though Fafurion is sealed within the cave, the dragon is becoming stronger every day. Please put Fafurion to eternal rest and bring peace to Heine.</p>
