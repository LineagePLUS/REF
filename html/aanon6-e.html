<p>Gunter... in my life, I have known him to be a lamp that illuminates the darkness.  He was always a close friend no matter what situation I was in.  But my business dealings with the Pretender King sorely disappointed my friend and since then, we have forgotten our old kinship and become enemies.</p>
<p>I would like to patch things up with Gunter again but I feel really frustrated because I cannot even find out where he is now.</p>
