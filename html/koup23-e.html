It's very difficult to handle silver when making weapons because silver is naturally soft and isn't easily strengthened. But with the right ingredients, that task can be done.
<br>
Make 40 dark stones, 30 brave stones and 1 wise stone and bring them to me with 1 dark claw. We'll also need 1 diamond, 10 lumps of iron and 10 hard leathers.
