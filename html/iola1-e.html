<p> A gremlin is a very bad baby goblin. He is very interested in people's items and if he sees something dropped on the ground, he quickly runs over, picks it up and runs away.<br>
I don't know if it's because he moves so fast, but it's really hard to chase him down alone. Granted, he doesn't hurt people directly but he is definitely a detestable monster anyway. <br>
I just think that it could be a lot of fun to chase those speedy gremlinsand have them race around.
