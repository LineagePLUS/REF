<br>Did my brother Taeha send you?
<br>For a little more I 'll trade you a seal of harmony for a seal of mental ability.
<br>Don't you think it's time you finally traded for something useful?
<br>
<br>You should snap this up while you have the chance!
<br>
<br>My brother and I each have our own special items. Make sure you deal with the one who has what you need.
<br>We're both gamblers, but I don't know what that says about our business ability...
