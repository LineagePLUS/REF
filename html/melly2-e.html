<p>As far as I know, no one has ever gone all the way to the top of the Tower of Insolence. Though you can't fathom how many adventurers have tried, the people who have actually returned alive can be counted on one hand. I don't think anyone will ever conquer that mysterious tower.
<p>According to those who have lived to return from the tower, there are incredible devils living there. The king, who had the arrogance to challenge the gods, is said to be forever trapped and tormented inside the tower as punishment from the gods... It makes you think of how amazing the greed of humans is and how serious the price is for such insolence...</p><br>
