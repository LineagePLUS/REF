<p> A Pledge house is one of the houses in a town that can be owned by a Blood Pledge. Rulers may acquire a Pledge house through auction if their Blood Pledge is at <font fg=ffffff>level 15 or above. </font>  Blood Pledges who already own a castle may not also own a Pledge house. <BR> If a member of a Blood Pledge that has a Pledge house is killed in the game, he starts again from his Blood Pledge's Pledge house. When a member uses Scroll of Return - Pledge House, he or she is returned to the Pledge house rather than a nearby village. The recovery rates for HPs and MPs inside of a Pledge house are faster than normal.<BR>
