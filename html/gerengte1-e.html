<p>You have come to the right place. Talking Island has long been known as the training mecca for Wizards... To be honest, there seem to be a lot more people who come here to receive training as a Knight these days, rather than learn magic.</p>
<br>
<p>All the skilled Wizards have left the island for the Ivory Tower of Oren or settled in their own private laboratories near the Elven Forest... The only person remaining decently capable of teaching magic is myself.</p>
