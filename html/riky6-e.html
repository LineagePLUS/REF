<P>You there... are you an apprentice Knight? You aren't perchance an agent the Pretender King sent over, are you? Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<P>Looking at you, I remember my own youth.</p>
<P>A long time ago, in when I was young, I was also an enthusiastic and energetic Knight like you.</p>
<P>Back then, I thought I could solve all the world's problems with passion only.</p>
<P>But now, I am no more than a weak, helpless old man.</p>
<P>I'm trying to spend the remaining years of my life compensating for all my past sins. </p>
<P>You could say that I am making an effort to win back the years of my youth that were ill spent with greed for wealth and power...</p>
<P>Every time I listen to Sir Gereng speak, I unconsciously shed tears of penitence for my past vice and am filled with respect for him. I feel the horrible memories of my past sins being purified one by one. The filthy eyes of the Pretender King cannot even compare.</p>
