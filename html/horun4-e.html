<p>Ent, fairy, arachne, and pan. According to legend they were just trifling existences at the beginning, but when Einhasad created Elves, She selected those four races among Her creations to appoint as guardians of the forest and Elves.</p>
<p>It's said that She created ent from a sapling born of the World Tree, arachne from a spider who made his lair on the World Tree, pan from a goat grazing nearby grasses, and the fairy from a butterfly who had flown to the flowers beside the World Tree. He gave these races a duty to protect all the forest and the Elves who followed Her therein.</p>

<br>
<p>Guardians will protect Elves and are aggressive towards non-Elves in the forest....I am an exception because of my master, and my Elven friends.</p>
<p>But even if you are of Elven blood, if you have killed other Elves, humans, or guardians, then guardians will not tolerate your presence -- and the power of angry guardians is indeed something to be concerned about.</p>
