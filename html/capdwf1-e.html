<p>Were you sent by Montes?
<p>Montes has made the right choice. We, at the Iron Gate Guild, can protect your people from the arrogant Lastabad. Ha Ha!
<p>Errr, you didn't come to us empty handed, did you? For a small present of gratitude, we can be very generous.
<p>But, it would be too forward for us to ask for anything specifically, don't you think? We are not without class... Ha ha!
<br>
<p>But you will not always find a good natured guy like myself. Lately there is something my race is especially interested in obtaining. 
<br>
<p>What is it you ask? Lately, something called a black lump of pure mithril has become very popular in our Iron Gate Guild… I don't know exactly what that does. According to rumor, it is just a sparkling black colored lump and if you cut it into a round ball, I hear that it looks like a black pearl.
<br>
<p>Can you picture it? Take a look at my armor and axe. I'm talking about the same material used to make these. Look!
