<p>Usually twigs of ent are used for bows or arrows, and sometimes they are used for clothes by extracting thread from them. The thick barks are often used for armor. But these materials also contain magical properties...</p>
<p>For example, both twigs and barks of ent affect the arachne strongly, accelerating their speed of producing webs or ecdysis.</p>
<p>The precious fruit of ent is very good for healing...similarly, there is a legend that a twig of ent can neutralize all kinds of poisons.</p>
<br>
<p>To get a twig of ent, you must simply punch them, causing their dead twigs to fall...but to get a bark you have to apply <a link="horun7">fungus juice</a> at first because it is quite hard to peel normally.</p>
