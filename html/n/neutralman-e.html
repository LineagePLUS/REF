<p>Do you see the red and blue names standing on both sides of me? The blue names are those belonging to people who steadily practiced good deeds. The red names are for the people who commit many evil sins. Me? Well, names like mine in white are for those who have not leaned in any directions yet. Everybody begins their adventures in a neutral state like this. I am very curious which path you will end up choosing between lawfulness and chaos. Who knows? You may keep neutral until the end like me!
