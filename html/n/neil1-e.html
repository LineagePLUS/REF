Giran has a lot of trade and military influence in Aden. The current Giran lord is always worried about rebels that might rise in his town. 
If the king gets angry, madness will surely strike in Giran town. Gludin town is a good example of that. <br>
If that happens here...ohh, just thinking about it gives me the chills.
