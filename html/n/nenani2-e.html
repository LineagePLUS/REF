<p>Gora Agni...the chief of the Agni tribe. He used to have some peculiar ideas and kept talking about coexistence with humans. But no one would listen to him, so he took his learning of human society and taught his tribe members to cooperate. And he succeeded, more or less.
<p>Other members of the tribal community regard him as a heretic. But he has always used the money from the human society for the tribal community.
<p>...it's being used for your war right now.
