<br>
<p>A reckless fool of a beginner charges on without thinking of his own bodily injuries. But an experienced expert knows better than that and takes care of his body. You should know that this is completely different from shirking away from danger in a cowardly fashion. And I am sure that as the number of your wounds and scars add up, you will learn this lesson well. Whenever you are injured, come straight to me and I will treat you. But it would be wise not to think that I am always here for you. As I just mentioned, you should learn not to seek a healer when you are hurt, but to avoid getting hurt in the first place.
