I'm trying to get the hang of this shape changing thing. If you'll let me practice on you, I will cast a spell that will temporarily transform you into some type of creature. The enchantment will only last 30 minutes.
<br><br>You'll also take on some of the attributes of the creature you choose.<br>
The cost for this spell is 100 adena.
