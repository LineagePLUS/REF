When you see <a link="narhenE10">pans</a> moving through the forest you may think that
they are <a link = "narhenE2">straightforward and violent</a>. But they are actually a delicate race, and they love music. They especially like the sounds of <a link="narhenE3">magic flutes</a> at the full moon.
<br>They are my friends; they always understand and love my music.<br>
However... It seems that a sad melody of war has covered the earth... I just hope the creatures that love nature aren't harmed by it...
