The Elder thinks you are here to help us but I know better.
<br>
If it wasn't for fools like you messing things up for us, we'd enjoy a good life. We know how to survive around here.
<br>
This cave is not our original habitat. All we can hope for here is a safe place to lay our heads at night.
<br>
Do-gooders like you do nothing but make our existence harder. Go away!
