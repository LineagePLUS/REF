<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Ramuse:</p></font> <br> My husband was a merchant... He was carrying out trade between Talking Island in the south and here in Aden. It was a night so dark that even the stars seemed to have been swallowed up by the sky and disappeared. It was said that on that night a war broke out in the southern region....<br> I received a letter a few days ago that my husband was killed in the attack of the Dark Elven army... I don't know how I can possibly go on...<br>
