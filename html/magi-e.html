I will cast a spell that will morph you into a creature of your choice. You'll also take on the attributes of the creature you choose-becoming faster or stronger depending on type--Some can even cast magical spells! Choose wisely! Some monsters have disadvantages as well. They may be slower, incapable of wearing armor, or wielding certain weapons.

This powerful service requires a fee of 500 adena.
