In order to increase the brilliance and strength of the dark crossbow, I need brave stones and wise stones, which are much more pure than dark stones. If your mental powers are accompanied by an equal degree of patience, go and get these ingredients.<br>
Bring me 1 dark crossbow, 100 brave stones, 20 wise stones, 10 lumps of iron and 30 hard leathers.
