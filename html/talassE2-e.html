<p>Demons have been sealed in the Ivory Tower since long ago. But now that seal is losing its power and a stronger one is needed. I've got to have a Bone Piece of Undead to rectify this but the problem now is that there aren't any Bones of Undead in the Ivory Tower. Duke Digardeng came to give help but he still hasn't been able to find a clear method of solving the issue. Looking at the Mystery Staff that you are holding, I can see there is a flaw in it that someone might have made. If you'll bring me a Bone Piece of Undead, I will fix that flaw by enchanting your Mystery Staff with magic.
