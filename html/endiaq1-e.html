<P>You are a Dark Elf with a pure soul...</p>
<P>Frankly... I have waited for this moment for a very long time.</p>
<br>
<P>You may already know this but my only reason for living is for the truth that must be passed on to Kima.</p> 
<P>But, it is too dangerous here... Please take me to Lyra in Fire-Field Farmer's Town, located west of here where there aren't any guardians.</p>
<br> <br> <a action="start">Accept Endia's request.</a><br>
