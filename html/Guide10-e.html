Congratulations <username>! At level 10 you graduate to the world of Aden.
<br><br>
Previously, you existed in a world where only other new characters were allowed. However, at level 10 you are required to leave and begin your journey in the wide open spaces of Aden. Many things are different and, while the risks are greater, so are the rewards. Keep in mind your training and you'll soon be famous throughout the lands!
