<p>Then, bring me back 100 filthy eyes that the Lastabads have scattered about! The Lastabad eye is a dirty, slimy living organism. The Lastabad army, lacking all sense of dignity, have released them to spy on Aden. They live on the optic nerves of other living organisms and steal the visual information their host obtains. If you can manage to carry out and complete this task, then, I will reconsider dealing with someone like you.
<p>This is to make people like you understand the difference between the proud Dark Elves of Silent Cavern and the thugs of Lastabad!
<p>Do you doubt my words? You'd better change your arrogant attitude or I'll make your eye the 100th victim. Unlike your kind, I don't play sly tricks or break my word!
<p>If you are planning on doing anything dishonorable or illegal, think again. Now get lost before I change my mind.
