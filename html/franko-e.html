<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Merchant of Antiquities, Franko:</p></font> <br>It's cold... really cold. <br>
<p>Ah! Oh, I'm glad you came.</p>
<p>We are a secret weapons shop that has everything, except for the things we don't have! Ha, ha! Why don't you pick out a weapon or some armor?</p>
<br>Do these look like normal weapons? You say the price is too high? <br>The weapons here are different than normal ones. Check out the things you bought using a scroll of identity. If you're lucky, you can obtain a strong weapon at a cheap price.
<br>
<p>Even if you thought you'd gotten a good item but turned out to be a dud, there are still lots of opportunities remaining to try again.</p>
