<p>You know, I really don't understand what's going on in the heads of people that make such a fuss about good, evil and justice.</p>
<p>Because my old friend Ronde has a bit of that evil disposition, it's really tiring to talk to him sometimes.</p>
<p>Dark Elf, Human, Orc... I couldn't care less. And I don't have any interest in participating in the conflicts of those that have nothing to be proud of except fighting and bloodshed.</p>
<p>So I have followed Elder Blu to this village. Not just me, but others like Hadesty are living quietly in this place too thanks to the influence of Blu.</p>
<p>Perhaps if Ronde were out doing his thing like before, the Human world and Elven Village would both have gone to ruin many years before. Do you think?</p>
<p>If people like Blu or Hadesty would step forward in this war again, the idiots from Lastabad would finally come to their senses.
