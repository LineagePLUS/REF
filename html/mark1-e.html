<p>It looks like you've come all the way out here to re-equip yourself with items you need from Ashur. Even though Ashur's provisions are sold at cheap prices, it's an extremely dangerous place to come because of all the ants that live here in the desert. 
<p>Seeing as you've come here knowing this fact... it shows you aren't afraid. Sir Knight, could you use that bravery on behalf of my friend Jim?
