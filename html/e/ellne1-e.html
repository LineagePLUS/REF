<p>Farming the burnt fields...bah! It's just sowing seeds in the field after burning the forest. The burned trees and grasses are turned to fertilizer so that we can grow our crops.<br>
We can use the field for three to four years, until the earth loses its meager fertility, then we must move and burn another forest... That's the way we earn our livelihood.<br><br>
Everyone here in this Fire-Farmers Village is poor and we are located a long way from the city and so even if the Dark Elves invade, they're sure not to reach this far, don't you think?<br>
Even though we live a hard life, at least it's good that we don't have to worry about that.
