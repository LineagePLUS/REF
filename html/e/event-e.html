<p>7/1 - 8/31, Lineage Player Appreciation Event!<br>
This event is a bonus occasion provided to show our appreciation for all Lineage users.<br>
<br>
"Enjoy Lineage! Get the Bonus!"<br>
T-shirts are just the beginning, as we'll also be giving away 50 Microsoft wheel mice and two Compaq notebook computers every week (for a total of 12) -- and every month, a game PC that every gamer dreams about!<br>
<br>
Participate now. The choice is clear. 
<br>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Bonus 1</font>
<br><b>Everyone</b> who joins Lineage as a full-subscription player during the event period will receive a specially-made Lineage collection t-shirt.
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf><p>Bonus 2</font>
<br>Everyone who joins as a full-subscription player for at least three months during the event period will receive a Lineage jigsaw puzzle (1000 pieces). Of course, you'll still get the Lineage collection t-shirt.
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf><p>Bonus 3</font>
<br>Every week, 50 people who have joined as regular players during the event period will be selected by lottery to receive a Microsoft Wheel Mouse.
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf><p>Bonus 4</font>
<br>Every week during the event, the male and female character in a particular class with the highest level will be determined and each will receive a Compaq notebook computer -- for a total of 12 computers during the entire event. Each week (except for the last week), a character class (Prince/Princess, Knight, Elf or Wizard) will be chosen and the highest level male and female character in that class will each be awarded a notebook computer (Compaq Armada 15000C).
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf><p>Bonus 5</font>
<p>In the last week of each month, the top Blood Pledge will be determined and the lord of that pledge will be awarded what every game maniac longs for -- a Fantasy Game PC.
