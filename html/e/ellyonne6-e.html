<p>Hmm... You say you are interested in the Line of Water?
<p>Water is the spirit with the most mild characteristics.
<p>The sympathetic spirits of water have hardly any interest in harming others.
<p>Their powers are expressed as compassion and love and a user will gain a healing power that is stronger than that of a Wizard's spell.
<p>If you find more pleasure in helping the injured than in violent battlefields, the spirits of water are sure to smile upon you.
