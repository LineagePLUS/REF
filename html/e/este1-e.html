<p>Actually we elves are part of the forest and can talk with trees in the language of nature. But some elves who have lived a long time among the humans have lost that language. Those who can't talk with the trees can become lost in the forest and so they've made a thing called a <font fg=ffffff>map</font> with help from the humans.<br><br>
If you are interested in the human culture, I can give you one. But in return, you have to pay me one <font fg=ffffff>twig of ent</font>. That's because humans always seem to want some form of payment...</p>
