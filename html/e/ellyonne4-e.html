<p>Spirit magic, as the name suggests, is magic that takes its energy from the spirits that embody the fundamental energies of this world.
<p>The reason humans cannot use this magic is because people are, unlike Elves, nowhere near forming a comradeship with the spirits.
<p>Spirit magic can be classified into five lines.
<p>They are: the Common Line, the Line of Fire, the Line of Water, the Line of Wind and, lastly, the Line of Earth.
<p>There are no problems at all in practicing the Common Line which I mentioned first. Any Elf with enough experience and the ability to control magic can learn the Common Line.
<p>But the remaining four types of magic do present problems.
<p>The spirits influence each other more strongly than we could imagine. I don't need to tell you about the reciprocal effects between opposite elements like fire and water or wind and land. Even for unopposing elements, the fusion effects are beyond our imagination. Therefore, using the magic of different lines together could even lead to death for the caster...
<p>I am continuing my research, but due to the fusion effects, it is only possible at this time to master the Common Line and one of the four element lines simultaneously.
<p>If you gain mastery in one line of magic and then insist on learning more about the magic of another line, you'll need to rid yourself of all your former spiritual powers, except for a few very basic skills. Otherwise, the burden on your body will be immense.
<p>Once you have set your heart on a special line of magic, or wish to get rid of one type of magic you have already acquired, just let me know.
