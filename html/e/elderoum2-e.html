<br>
Um... It looks like you don't know about this place or about us.
<br>
This is where, after fleeing the forced slavery at the mineral mine, some Oums came to live in order to hide from the Dark Elves. A few had gathered their strength together to escape and after great hardship, they finally found this safe place. I live here together with them and am leading them with the knowledge I have accumulated.
<br>
<br>
As the leader of these Oums, there is something I want to tell you which is of utmost importance.
<br>
OK... You don't know much about us Oums, do you? The Oums are beings created by the Giants a very long time ago.
<br>
We were their servants, working to build buildings or carry things for the Giants.
<br>
<br>
But for some unknown reason, our masters, the Giants, all just disappeared one day. And we still don't know the reason for that.
<br>
Anyway, after that the Dark Elves -- with their dark skin and red eyes -- came here. They were not native to this place and so asked for our help to live. And since we knew all about life here, we were glad to help them.
<br>
In their adapting to life here, a lot of different events came to pass, but... we never would have thought something would happen to prevent us from living properly.
<br>
<br>
However, then the attitude of the Dark Elves toward us changed. They stopped asking for our help or making requests and instead forced us to build their buildings and mine for minerals.
<br>
Some of the Oums protested against or refused these things but the Dark Elves either killed them or dragged them off to some unknown place and we were not able to prevent this.
<br>
Because of those things, we Oums went to their leader many times but we were not able to meet him whom we had spent time with before.
<br>
Finally, we ended up being subjugated by them so that we couldn't fight anymore and now our race just lives as slaves for them.
<br>
<br>
Hmm... I saw that you of the land have fought against the Dark Elves.
<br>
So, I'd like to make a difficult but fervent request of you... 
<br>
I want to ask if you could help us Oums escape from under the Dark Elves.
<br>
We just don't have the bravery and strength that you have.
<br>
<br>
OK, I knew that it would be difficult for you to consent to this offhand.
<br>
If you change your mind later, could you please come back and see me again?
