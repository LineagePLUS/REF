<p>Fire is the spirit that symbolizes the purest power.
<p>It has the ability to burn all the energy hidden in oneself in order to destroy and purify everything else. 
<p>In other words, the spiritual magic of fire is the most aggressive of the four lines.
<p>If you use a sword as your main weapon and wish to reinforce your ability to destroy opponents, it would be wisest for you to choose the Line of Fire.
