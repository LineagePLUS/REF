<p>Spirit magic, as the name suggests, is magic that takes its energy from the spirits that embody the fundamental energies of this world.
<p>The reason humans cannot use this magic is that people are, unlike Elves, nowhere near forming a comradeship with the spirits.
<p>Spirit magic can be classified into five lines.
<p>They are: the Common Line, the Line of Fire, the Line of Water, the Line of Wind and, lastly, the Line of Earth.
