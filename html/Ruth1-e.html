<br>Hello <username>. 
<br><br>
Would you like to know about armor?
<br><br>
<p>Go to Shari, the leather craftsman who lives in the northern part of Hidden Valley. You should take her seven furs--hunt deer or kobolds for fur.
<br>When you have the furs, ask to Shari make you a leather shield. 
<br>Once you've equipped the shield, look at your Armor Class on the lower left of your screen. Did it go down by one number? Remember, a lower AC is better.
<br><br>
Alternatively, you may receive weapons or armor from monsters that you kill which are better than the armor or weaponry you currently possess.
