<p>Ishmael Gregheim, the most powerful person in this estate, is my father. He was a noble of this province and served Count Gludia, but when the Count was persecuted by Ken Rauhel my father was chosen as a chamberlain by Ken Rauhel. Because I couldn't forgive him, I came here with some farmers, leaving behind my past and status as a Knight.
<p>Though I ran, I find I can't desert the people suffering from the war.
