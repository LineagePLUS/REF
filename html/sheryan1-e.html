<p>This is just my opinion... I think it is very unfitting that the hamlet of the gypsies is located so close to the great Aden City, don't you? It just seems so inappropriate that this slum is left here in the kingdom.<br>
I wish that the Dark Elves that have caused the war in the south would properly clean out the gypsy town...
