<font fg=ffffaf>Attack:</font>
<p> <font fg=ffffff>Click</font>* on a target to attack. Only certain targets may be attacked this way.<br>

<font fg=ffffaf><p>War between Blood Pledges:</font>
<p>A Blood Pledge leader can declare war with another pledge. From the Chat Window, type
<font fg=ffffff>"/war [name of Blood Pledge against which to declare war]"</font>. The leader of that pledge will decide whether or not to go to war.
<p>When two Blood Pledges are at war, members of one pledge can attack members of the other without pressing the Ctrl key and vice versa. Also, safe areas are ignored during war, killing an opponent doesn't affect the participants' alignments and there is no punishment from the guards. (However, the safe areas are not ignored on the non-PVP server.)<br>
<p>There are three ways to end a war.
<p>- Peace treaty: A truce can be proposed by either warring Blood Pledge and if the other pledge accepts, peace is declared.  From the Chat Window, type <font fg=ffffff>"/cease [name of opposing Blood Pledge]"</font> to propose a truce. The opposing pledge decides whether to accept the proposal or not.
<p>- Surrender: Surrender unconditionally to the opposing pledge. From the Chat Window, type <font fg=ffffff>"/surrender [name of opposing Blood Pledge]"</font> to surrender. In this case too, the opponent must recognize the surrender.
<p>- Kill the leader of the opposing pledge or lose your own pledge leader.
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf><p>Siege:</font>
<p>A pledge who doesn't own a castle or a pledge house can declare war against a pledge who does. This is called "laying siege" to the castle. To declare a siege, you can use the same command as for normally declaring war - "/war [name of Blood Pledge that owns the castle]". To learn the name of the Blood Pledge that owns the castle, talk to some merchants or guards at the castle gate. However, the following conditions must be met in order to declare a siege.
<p>- Only a pledge leader of level 25 or above can declare a siege.
<p>- War can be declared only during specific times. The pledge leader that owns the castle can determine the time for the next siege. If the pledge does not declare a time, the game will automatically set the siege time after four days. To learn this time talk to a security guard in front of the castle.</p>
<br>
<p>A siege usually happens in the following order:
<p>- First, war is declared against the Blood Pledge that owns the castle. At this point, if the attacking pledge has already infiltrated ten people into the outer castle wall, the owner of the castle can reject the declaration of war by that attacking pledge. However, except in this circumstance, the castle owner automatically must accept the declaration of war. 
<p>- To infiltrate the outer wall of the castle, the attacking party has to destroy the outer gate of the castle while fighting other PCs and NPCs defending the castle. The castle gates can be destroyed by using weapons held by the PCs, but since the hard wood of the gates is reinforced with iron, steel-edged weapons such as swords and spears won't inflict significant damage. Furthermore, edged weapons may be damaged due to the successive impacts on the hard surface. Damaged weapons can be fixed at the blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>- Once members of the attacking party get inside the outer wall, the Suho Tap structure can be seen on the inner field. If the Suho Tap is attacked and destroyed, the crown falls. The castle can be taken by the Blood Pledge if the head of that pledge takes the crown.
<p>- Only the head of the pledge can attack and break the glass box around the crown. If the castle is taken from the pledge who had the crown, the Suho Tap is restored. The other pledge members are expelled outside the castle and, until the siege time is completed, a siege can be declared against the pledge holding the castle.<p>
<br>
<p>One thing to remember is that the siege automatically ends when the sun goes down.  So, even if the castle is taken temporarily in a siege, if this cannot be defended until the end of the day, the effort is wasted. Remember that the winner of that day's siege is the person possessing the castle at the moment the sun goes down.<p><br>

Other items regarding war follow the general rules of war between Blood Pledges. However, if a pledge fails in its attempt to take over the castle, the members will be branded as rebels and hunted by guards for some time to come.<br><br>
