<p>Right now I am extremely busy so I'd like for you to handle a small task for me.</p> 
<p>Recently, some lowly orcs have invaded the Silence Ground. Pretty ironic, wouldn't you say? Creatures that were once conquered by Humans are now thinking to challenge us?  </p>
<p>What do you say? Would you like the chance to help me and prove yourself?</p>
