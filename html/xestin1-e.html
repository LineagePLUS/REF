Hey! I can't imagine why those filthy Oums are moving so slowly! 
They are genetic half-breeds of the spirit of the earth and ogres. The ancient Giants created them but... all they're good for is to work as slaves. And now, just as we are facing the enemy, their production of rocks from the mines is dropping! They must be driven to work harder!<br>
Why do we even keep them around here? They supposedly exist only to be exploited by the Dark Elves, but they just keep running away. If I ever get my hands on one of them...
