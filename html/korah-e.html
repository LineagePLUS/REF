<P>Listen, and I can teach you a valuable lesson.
<P>There are many potions available throughout the land. Potions that can heal you, increase your speed, cure you of poison--all exist in this land.</P>
<P>You can acquire these potions in various ways. Some monsters drop certain potions. Also, you can buy them from merchants or even other players. Don't be shy!</P>
<P>Since you're new around here, I'll help you out. You bring me some items I need and I'll give you a healing potion.</P>
