<P>The abilities to fight with weapons? Such abilities are indeed very important. But, young friend, they say that in the Garm mountains, west of <a link="gunterk4">the Kingdom of Elmore</a>,even the bandits are known to fight with unearthly swordsmanship.</p>
<p>A true Knight knows that one must wield his <a link="gunterk5">weapon</a> with caution and respect.</P>
<p>A Knight must understand that dangers lie in becoming more strong, more powerful. With power comes responsibility. While young, those with wisdom might stay your hand.  But when your power can make the earth shudder, who but yourself will be able to keep your course true?  This great power is why finding a true leader is so important.</p>
