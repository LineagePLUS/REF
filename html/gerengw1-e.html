<p>Greetings, worthy pupil. According to legend, Talking Island has long been a <a link="gerengw2">training ground for Wizards</a> like yourself.  Nowadays most souls come here to be Knights.  As near as I can tell, the magic teachers left for the Ivory Tower at Oren or set up a laboratory near the Forest of Elves...now I am the only one left who can teach magic.
