<p>If you bring twigs of ent (which you can get by hitting ents with your bare hands) to <a link="theodorE4">Nerupa</a>, she can make you bows, arrows, spears, or swords. And they can also be used to make clothes by extracting threads from the <a link="theodorE5">arachne</a>.
Furthermore, you can neutralize poison by chewing them. Sometimes ents drop fruit, and that has the power to heal Elven bodies. Ents' bodies are helpful to us; such is Einhasad's will. Sometimes I have doubts whether it is right for one life form to exist solely for another life.</p>
