I am selling Christmas trees for pledge houses in honor of the holiday season.<br>
Here's how it works.<br>
<br>
It would be too difficult to lift and put up a huge Christmas tree on your own, don't you think?<br>
That's why we handle the set up and removal of the tree with just the click of the ticket.<br>
<br>
The tree can only be put up inside a pledge house.<br>
If you click the Christmas tree ticket on the location in the pledge house where you want the tree, the tree will automatically be set up in that location.<br>
After setting it up, the ticket remains in the Item Window but you can't set up the tree multiple times.<br>
You can only set up one Christmas tree with a single ticket.<br>
<br>
Don't like where you put the tree?<br>
OK, just click the ticket again in the installed location.<br>
Then the tree is removed and you can set it up again in a new location.<br>
<br>
Oh, there's one thing to be careful about regarding tree set up. <br>
Keep in mind that you can only set up a Christmas tree when facing in the northern or western directions and, the tree cannot be exchanged or deleted. Ho ho ho!<br>
<br><br>
<p>Have a very happy holiday!
