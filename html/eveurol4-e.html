<p>The ruins at the bottom of the lake are said to be from a great underwater kingdom that Eva ruled herself long ago. According to the legend of the founding of Heine, when Fafurion appeared in this world and polluted all the oceans and rivers and lakes so that humans couldn't drink the water, Eva sacrificed her kingdom to seal Fafurion at the bottom of the lake. She lead the people personally onto the land and built a castle, now known as Heine Castle.</p>
