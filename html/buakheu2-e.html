Who is Fafurion, you ask? The very one responsible for <a link="buakheu3">this barren, lonely landscape</a> you are looking at.</p>
<p>
The water dragon Fafurion has been fighting from the beginning of time with Eva, the owner of the water and all creatures living in the water. Right now, Eva has Fafurion sealed inside the East Cave, but until we destroy it completely, the evil air contaminating this place will not disappear.</p>
