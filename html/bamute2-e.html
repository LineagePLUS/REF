<p>Cursed leather must be made by tanning cimaera skin but such work is extremely delicate. That's because cimaera skin possesses the powers of the four elements and so each element must be handled separately. If it is tanned like ordinary leather, the precious material will be completely destroyed.
<p>The four kinds of cimaera skin are "lion", "dragon", "goat" and "snake" and they represent the four elements of "fire", "water", "wind" and "earth", respectively. I charge 500 adena for my services.
