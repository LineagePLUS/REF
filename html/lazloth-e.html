<p>...What's an adventurer like you doing in a far away place like this?
<p>My name is Lazloth and I am in charge of the Elmore Border Camp.
<p>This camp used to be on the front lines during the Invasion Wars of Elmore. But these days, we pay more attention to other things besides national defense.
<p>Soldiers of Elmore who died during past battles have become monsters. They appear from time to time around the area and attack the people of Aden. Perhaps they cannot forget the grief of bleeding to death in a foreign country.
<p>It won't be a problem if you are fully capable. But, if you are not, please take my advice and leave immediately. Though we are trying our best, there are just too many of those immortal ghosts wandering around and, to be honest, we cannot cope with the present situation.
<p>We are looking for the best solution to rid us of the current problem. Perhaps we will seek help from adventurers like you in the future.
<p>No matter how much damage the ghosts cause, it would really be difficult for the camp soldiers to go out and conquer them.
<p>Please do help us out if the chance arises. Let me also repeat my words of caution: be careful out there.
