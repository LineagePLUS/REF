<p>It's my dream to catch one someday. </p>
<p>Why? I don't know... I've never heard of anyone catching a whale before. But it's not an issue of why - I'm a fisherman, and catching a whale is like fighting against the master of an unknown world.</p>

<p>Hmm...It looks like that is an alien concept to mud-stompers...er, land people like you. Go battle some goblins or frogs instead.</p>
