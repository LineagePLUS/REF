<p>The Dark Elves conspiring with the Pretender King are said to be hiding in certain villages among Humans. They are masters of disguise so it will be very difficult to find them.</p> 
<p>That is why you need the hit list enchanted with ancient sorcery that I have given you. The ancient sorcery will draw out their hiding.</p>
<p>Just remember to return to me if you're unsuccessful with your first attempt. A good assassin never gives up.</p>
<p>A word of advice, you would be wise to use your assassin's weapons, rather than trying to rely on magic to defeat these particular Dark Elves.</p>
