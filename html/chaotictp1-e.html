<p>...All things... have to follow their true nature...
<p>......Gran Kain, the father of all things, was evil.  Therefore, everything is inherently evil...  Thus, all things should work to reveal their true nature. All things must be free to be true 'Evil'.
<p>...The books containing the truth of Gran Kain, the God of evil and freedom, are sought after by all monsters who wish to become more evil. If you also want to gain evil power, you should take the Libram of Evil from these monsters.  Then, when the truth of evil is echoing here, you will gain part of the Evil God's power.
<br>
<p>This is Gran Kain's justice, His will.
<br><br>
<p>But ... You should never speak the teachings of the God of Restriction and Oppression here. Woe to the one who restricts freedom...
