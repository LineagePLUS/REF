<p> What do you think is the most powerful thing in the world? Is it the legendary dragon? Is it a fire lich?<br><br>
No... I think the strongest thing on earth is the will and solidarity of people. If many people put their energy together, there really isn't any monster that can defeat them...and I'm even talking about the legendary dragons! <br><br>
From what I hear in the news recently, the Dark Elven army invaded the land in the south and things had gotten out of hand. But thanks to the strong will and solidarity of everyone, the people are finally overcoming the enemy.<br><br>
But if young people like you were to join together in strong unity and fight, I think you'd definitely be able to defeat those Dark Elven invaders.
