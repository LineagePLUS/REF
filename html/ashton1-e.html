<p>Sigh... Several years' hard work for nothing - all due to the attacks of the Dark Elven army! I may have to enter the Northern Forest to work on the <a link="ashton2">Fire-fields</a> like the others... From what I've heard, an Aden protection force has been formed and is counter attacking against the army of the Dark Elves and so that just shows how war leads to more war.<br>
If there is a war now, it would be really terrible.
