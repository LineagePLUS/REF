<p>When Einhasad first made us, we were like children that didn't know anything. So, to protect us from Gran Kain's evil might, She <a link="mothere7">selected a few creations</a> and gave them great power.</p>
<p>Einhasad ordered these guardians to "protect the Elves and this forest, which is home to the Elves". More than we can ever remember, they have protected us from long ago. That protection continues even now as these guardians help us <a link="mothere8">make our own weapons and armor</a> to defend ourselves.</p>
