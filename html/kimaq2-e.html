<p>Oh yeah? You'd sacrifice yourself for your master no matter what price you must pay?</p>
<p>Then I'm curious what you expect to get in return to make you decide that...</p>
<p>What perchance did your master say he'd give you if you completed the task? I bet it's like that.</p>
<br>
<p>Yup, that's Bludika all right. He's amazing. And very surprising! So how many must be sacrificed for that sleaze bag before people won't do things like that anymore?</p>
<p>Isn't it disgusting? For the one that leads the group and is to maintain the independence of the group to be continously surrounded by such vile thoughts!</p>
<br>
<p>I just don't have any interest anymore in the independence of the Dark Elves. No, I just don't care.</p>
<p>All I want to know is why Bludika and Ronde have kept their eyes on me for so long.</p>
<p>According to my old friend Khan, there is an answer to everything in the Elven Forest.</p>
<p>Of course, I could just go to the Elven Forest and get the answer myself but Bludika made it so that I can't even get close to there so I need your help.</p>
<p>It's not all that important whether you accept or don't accept my recommendation.</p>
<p>But you who have been charmed by your master will have to accept my request too. Ha, ha, ha.</p>
