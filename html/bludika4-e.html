<font fg=ffffff>Elder Bludika:</font> <br><br> From what I've heard, the high prefect appointed recently of Lastabad is called "Dantes."<br><br>It is said that he is extremely thorough and has a lot of ambition. Apparently, he calls himself the "Great Emperor" and has made all the preparations to incite this war.<br><br>

At the elders meeting when we were exiled, all the power had already been taken by Dantes and the other elders just rubber-stamped his decision. They say that even flowing water turns rancid if left to sit. The other elders, who have all been around a very long time and are praised for their wisdom, were blinded by their greed and didn't properly ascertain the situation.<br><br> Anyway, according to the rumors I've heard, the military force that he assembled is really impressive. Have you ever heard of the Four Great Kings? This attacking party that invaded Gludio is the army of one of those four. <br><br> Anyway, since the war has started, it is clear that a period of chaos is coming to the land. Please prepare yourself adequately for that. <br><br>
