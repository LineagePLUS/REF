<p>The Crystal Cavern is said to be connected to the base of the Glacial Lake. We know this because one time an adventurer got lost inside the Crystal Cavern. He only lived because he came up through the Glacial Lake, somehow.
<p>Isn't it strange? The entrance to the Crystal Cavern is far away from the lake. 
<p>And what's more interesting is that while there are several stories about adventurers escaping from the cave through the Glacial Lake in the same way, there have been absolutely no cases where an adventurer found the entrance to the Crystal Cavern from the Glacial Lake.
<p>Well, there really is no reason for me to worry about this, as I will never get a chance to see the Crystal Cavern anyway.
