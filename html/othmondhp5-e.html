<p>There are already guards posted to maintain security around the castle, but they are to maintain the peace only, and are not of use during the war. Considering that there are many small and large conflicts in the estate, we'd better prepare for the worst by hiring trustworthy mercenaries.
<p>Once you tell me the number and type of mercenaries, I'll ask around and gather trustworthy mercenaries by the same hour the next day.
<p>There are two types of mercenaries to defend our castle - one is the archer, who can shoot enemies trying to destroy the gate. The others are personal bodyguards to protect you and members of your Blood Pledge.
<p>I will arrange archers around the castle wall as soon as they are ready, but you have to decide how many bodyguards will be assigned to you and your members.
<p>Mercenaries will wait for your orders in the barracks at the south corner of outer castle. Once you make up your mind, talk to Hunt, the captain of the mercenary army <var src="#0"> -- he will assign mercenaries according to your order.
<br>
<p>Please remember that the money to hire mercenaries comes from the taxes gathered from residents of your land.
