<p>Your sword may lose its teeth if ya hit stone or a castle door with it. Also, haven't ya heard of monsters who can erode your armor or weapons? It's so stupid to hit a Stone Golem with a sword or spear.  Never mind the damage you're doing to yer weapon, those weapons can't really do much damage to those critters. It's all right to hit 'em with blunt or heavy weapons like morning stars or axes, though.</p>
