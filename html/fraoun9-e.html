<p>Just as you need a strong weapon when attacking, you should carry good armor for protection. It may sound like I am ranting on about an obvious fact, but try to understand that this is a very important issue deserving of such attention. No matter how strong an adventurer you are, if you become negligent regarding your protection, you will be struck down in the blink of an eye and could lose your valuable items and precious experience. In order to avoid such misfortune, you need to effectively use armor that is well-suited to you. 
<br>
<p>The method for wearing and removing armor is exactly the same as for weapons. All you need to do is <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> the desired armor in the Item Window. Although you only need to distinguish between one-handed and two-handed items when selecting weapons, there are other issues that need special attention when selecting armor. For instance, armor can be put on only in the following order: <font fg=ffffff>clothing, armor and cloak</font>. Why you ask? Well, you wouldn't wear clothes over your armor or put on your armor over your cape, would you? Of course not. When you want to take off your armor, you must remove the cape first or else you will not be able to take off the armor or the clothes.
