<p>It was a quiet night... Suddenly the thunder of galloping horses was heard from far away, with the sound of many fighters from Kent Castle.<br><br>
I thought that it was just the sound of the lords fighting against each other as normal but then I also heard sounds that were much different than that. The howling of ferocious beasts and voices of strange creatures... And after a little time, the screaming of the guards could be heard and a sea of fire appeared near the village.<br><br>
Jaint and I quickly fled to the secret underground warehouse of our store... I can't tell you how much we shook with fear.
We spent two days there and when we came out, we saw that things had become quiet and the village had been turned to ruins...<br><br>
I wanted to run away but Jaint took a good look around and gave me courage... Now all I want is for our village to be returned to its previous condition.</p>
