<p>I'm glad you came. Talking Island has long been famous as a <a link="gerengw2">training ground for Wizards</a>... But recently, most people coming are here for Knight training instead... And all the competent Wizards have left the island for the Ivory Tower of Oren or to set up their own laboratories near the Elven Forest... Now there's no one left around here to teach students except me.
