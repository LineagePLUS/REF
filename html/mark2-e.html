<p>I know you are busy so I'll be brief.  I had a friend named Jim and we were so close that we would have died for each other. Now, my old friend Jim is missing...  I'm ashamed to admit it but I don't know where he is exactly.  I've been traveling with Ashur trying to find out more but all that I've been able to uncover is that he is trapped in a dungeon somewhere suffering under a curse that was put upon him... I beg of you, please help me to find my dear friend Jim and alleviate his suffering... I'm asking this as a favor.
