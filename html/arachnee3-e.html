<p>Our period of ecdysis and spinning thread is related to the Ent-kind. That's because an element found in <font fg=ffffff>the twig of Ent</font> helps us in producing <font fg=ffffff>the Web</font>, and an element in <font fg=ffffff>the bark of Ent</font> accelerates our <font fg=ffffff>ecdysis</font>.</p><br>
<p>As you can see, we guardians also depend on one another. From our perspective, no one can survive alone in this Forest - and you might learn from this as well.</p>
