<br>I'm sorry for what just happened. I mistook your actions for trying to make a fool of me.
<br>Did you say you want a Sugar Basket? Then I'll need 20 Sugars and a Basket price of 50 adena.
<br>I'm feeling bad for my misunderstanding so I'll do my best making this.
<br>
<br>I don't know who you're going to give it to but it must be a really lucky person.
