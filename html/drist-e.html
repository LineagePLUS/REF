<p>Hey, you there. Do you wish to return to the </font fg=ffffff>Hidden Valley?</font> If so, then don't hesitate like that; say what's on your mind. Knowing your own abilities is nothing to be ashamed of. On the contrary, you should be commended. If you so desire, return and train yourself without regret.
