<p>All Knights have a single dream in common.  Their greatest wish is to meet <a link = "gunterk6">a lord</a> who understands the Knight's abilities, and allows the Knight to pursue chivalrous virtues.</p>
<p>Only then can a Knight remain loyal to both his lord and his ideals.  A Knight torn between duty and virtue will forever be haunted.</p>
