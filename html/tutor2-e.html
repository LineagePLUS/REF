<p>Hello, <username>. I have something to tell you.
<br><br>

You will heal more quickly if you are well fed. Your nutrition state is displayed on the lower left of the screen -- by the icon that looks like a piece of meat. 

To obtain food, you should talk to a merchant or hunt certain wild animals. Rabbits and deer often drop meat. 

When you eat meat, you'll see your nutrition bar increase. To eat meat, or use an item, open your inventory and double-click the item.  
<br><br>
There are other things to eat out there, but meat is probably the most common thing you'll run into.
