<br>
<p>Due to Einhasad's blessing, Elves cannot die except by external causes.  But most of the old ones that lose their mental vigor after a certain age want to become one with nature.</p>
<p>At first, I tried to become one with the World Tree. But love toward my offspring prevented me from completely merging like the others. This has made me what I am now.</p>
<p>...Sometimes I envy my friends who found complete peace. But I wouldn't exchange for anything the happiness and pride I feel from seeing younger Elves like you.</p>
