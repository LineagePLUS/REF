<p>Ha, ha, ha. Frankly, I bet you already figured out that what we are doing is not exactly legal. So telling you about what we do would be, well...  But, I'll go ahead and let you in on a few things. This is for your ears only. OK?</p>
<br>As I mentioned, we do a business that isn't approved but such is what happens during times of chaos. <br><p>We belong to a certain guild and there are others in addition to me that sell these kinds of things. Near Oren, near Aden, etc.</p>
<p>And each person is selling different things. Magical items are being sold in Oren.</p>
<br>Well, well...
<p>That's enough for now...</p>
