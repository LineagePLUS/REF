The Wizard (or Mage) is an intermediate character class.  All Wizards start in Singing Island.  They rely primarily on magic for combat and may struggle before gaining the skill to cast spells. Mages will have to wait for their magic ability to recharge after heavy use. A good Wizard will have plenty of wisdom and intelligence to increase the power of their magic abilities.

Mages can use various magical powers, but their physical fighting abilities are weak.
