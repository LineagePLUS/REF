<p>It is very rare to see one blessed with a limited time in the Elven Forest.
How could you come to this place which is forbidden to you - you, who already control all the outside world?
<br>
You dominate the world, devouring as a flame consumes everything in its path.
<br>
But think on this:  once a flame is left with nothing else to devour...what then happens to it?
