<p>There are already guards to maintain the security of the castle and its territory, but they are there only for the purposes of security and cannot be employed in an actual war. Especially considering the various skirmishes breaking out in the region lately, it is advisable to prepare for such potentialities by employing skilled mercenaries. 
<p>If your highness will only tell me the types and numbers of soldiers needed, I will endeavor to find skilled mercenaries and arrange the necessary number by the same time on the day after my lord has spoken.
<br>
<p>Due to the structure of our castle, there are two types of soldiers that we need. We need archers on top of the outer wall to oppose enemies trying to break down the castle wall, and we need combat soldiers who will protect your highness or your highness' Blood Pledges. 
<p>In the case of archers, they will be deployed automatically as you command me. But in the case of combat soldiers, my lord or members of the Blood Pledge must decide how many will stand where on hiring them. 
<p>The combat soldiers are waiting in the barracks in the southern corner of the outer gate. Once you have decided on their deployment, you need only speak to the leader of the <var src="#0"> combat soldier troop for him to position them as you require. 
<br>
<p>Please draft the mercenary soldiers wisely keeping in mind that the money used to hire them comes from the taxes paid by the citizens.
