<p>The chief of the orcs is...Gora, I believe. I think I heard that name somewhere... The Black Forest to the north -- I heard you call it the Northern Forest. Anyway, Gora is one of the chieftains of the orc tribe there. I heard that when I was staying at Fire-field Farmers Town.
<p>It's strange that orcs in the forest are making trades in the town. I'm not sure whether the forest became too hard to live in, or if this place is just better for orcs than the forest.
