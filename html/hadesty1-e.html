<p>I work on behalf of the one that honors the gods of the Dark Elves.<br>
I try to provide a small comfort to my kinsmen that are exhausted by the anger and sadness they feel for the fate of our cursed race. Recently I've been thinking that the history of us Dark Elves is one of tears.<br><br>
The sun doesn't shine here but still you can come to me anytime you wish to rest your tired soul and injured body...
<p>I do, however, need a catalyst when using the magic of light so please prepare a bring stone for that...
