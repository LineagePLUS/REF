<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Explanation of Magic Terms:</font>
<br>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Caster</font>: The person casting a spell. </p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Spell Level of the Caster</font>: This number indicates the highest level of spells the caster can learn and use. Spell level has a strong relationship with a player's general level and the rate of spell level increase is different for each class. For Prince/Princess, the spell level rises by 1 for each increase of 10 levels. For Elves, it is 1 for 8 and for Wizards, it is 1 for 4.</p>
<p>There is also an upper spell level limit per class:  Prince/Princesses max out at spell level 2, Elves at 6, and Wizards at 10. Knights can learn level 1 magic when they reach a general level of 50.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Magic Bonus</font>: A high value of magic bonus is advantageous for using all types of spells (increases damage inflicted or success probability). This number increases in proportion to the caster's intelligence. There are also some items that can raise the magic bonus.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Magic Power (S.Power)</font>: As the sum of spell level and magic bonus, this value shows the overall power of the caster's magic. This number can be verified in the magic window and a higher value is advantageous for using magic.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Magic Resistance (M.Resist.)</font>: Higher magic resistance gives a player more power to resist harmful spells and also reduces the damage inflicted by magic. Basically, it increases with the caster's level and wisdom. There are also some items that can raise magic resistance.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Magic Type</font>: There are 8 types of spells: Heal, Bestow, Attack, Life, Death, Control, Curse and Transform. Some items strengthen one specific type of magic, or negate it. There are also monsters that are particularly resistant or vulnerable to specific types of magic.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Attribute of Magic</font>: Some spells have one of four attributes (fire, earth, air, water). The power of magic increases if used on a monster with the opposite attribute, but decreases if the attribute is the same. (Water and fire are opposites; as are earth and air.) PCs can also take on a specific attribute due to using certain items.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Alignment of Magic</font>: Each spell belongs to one of three alignments (lawful, neutral, chaotic). The alignment of the spell used can affect the caster's alignment. And some spells gain more power as the caster's alignment gets closer to the alignment of the respective spell.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Beam Magic</font>: Some spells shoot a beam from the caster. These are called beam magic, and only some items (i.e. Shield of Reflection) can affect this type of spell.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Target of Magic</font>: Every spell has its own possible target. If the correct target is not designated, the spell won't work. The following are the possible targets of magic.
<p> - Caster: It only affects the caster that is using the magic.
<p> - PC: It affects a PC on the screen.
<p> - NPC: It affects a monster on the screen.
<p> - Pledge: It affects a PC or PCs whose Blood Pledge is the same as the caster.
<p> - Enemy: It affects a monster or member of a Blood Pledge that is at war with the caster's pledge.
<p> - Item: It affects an item that the caster is carrying.
<p> - Location: It affects a single point -- usually a point on the screen.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Ingredients:</font>
<p>In order to cast some spells, magic gems are needed. The required number is specified in the help screen for each spell.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Learning Magic:</font>
<p>The spells of Level 3 or below may be purchased with adena from the NPC wizards located at designated places. Players can learn from NPCs in Hidden Valley or on the Singing Island and also from Horun who is near the Elven Forest. On the Talking Island, players can learn from Gereng who lives on the east side of the island. Of course, one must be at a high enough level to learn the spells.
<p>For spells of Level 4 or higher, one must go to the temple corresponding to the alignment of the magic to learn the knowledge stipulated for each level. Also, this magic can be learned in the magic training room of the Ivory Tower.
