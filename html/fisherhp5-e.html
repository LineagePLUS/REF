<p>There are already enough guards to oversee the security of the castle and the territory, but these are human resources designated to maintain general safety and no more -- they are not fit for direct participation in battle. Since many conflicts are breaking out in the territory, you better hire capable mercenaries and prepare to defend your territory.
<p>Tell me the number and type of mercenary soldiers you require, my lord. I will seek out able bodies and gather the necessary number by this hour tomorrow.<br>
<p>Because of the castle structure, there are two types of mercenary soldiers required. One type is the archer, on the outer castle walls, to stop enemies from destroying the castle walls and gate. The other type is the personal bodyguard, who will protect you and your Blood Pledge members.
<p>The archers are placed instantly when you just command me to assemble them, but you need to decide how many bodyguards you would like to deploy for yourself and your Blood Pledge.
<p>The mercenaries wait in the tent at the southern corner of the outer castle. After planning how to arrange them, go to the front of the tent and talk to Vaiger, chief commander of the <var src="#0"> mercenaries. He will then deploy his soldiers as you wish.
<br>
<p>The money you spend to hire mercenaries is also taken from the tax you collect from the residents of the territory. Please remember this and hire the soldiers wisely.
