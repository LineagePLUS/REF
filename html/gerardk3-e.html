<p>The Knight's existence has meaning only when he meets the lord to whom he will pledge his loyalty. In this chaotic time, there are numerous Princes claiming to be descended from royal blood.  During the confusion that resulted from the Pretender King's horror, much was left in chaos, and now it takes a virtuous will to find a true Prince. 'Tis time for Knights to decide who deserves their loyalty - you must find a lord with true blood and virtue before swearing your allegiance!
