<p>Your sword may lose its teeth if ya hit stone or a castle door with it. Also, some monsters can erode your armor or weapons.  It's stupid to hit stone golems with a sword or spear -- it damages the weapon more than the monster!</p>
<p>Well, you may opt to throw yer weapon away if that happens, but if ya bring it to me, I can make it as good as new.</p>
