<p>Looking at your attire, I would say you are from the Singing Island.

<p>Did you know that you can use the underground dungeon as a passage between Singing Island and Hidden Valley? 

<p>If you wish to go back to Singing Island, I will be glad to transport you to the dungeon, but it is up to you to get through to the other side!
