<p>Ho! If you're trying to strike up a conversation with me, you must be full of confidence. "No longer need to train in this Valley"... is that what you are saying?  Fine. Are you ready?  Ready to enter a world where, unlike here, no one will come to protect you? Into a tough and evil world that's also vast and warm?
<br>
<p>But if you ever feel that you need more training, do not hesitate to ask <font fg=ffffff>Drist</font> to help you return. I trust you know the difference between courage and recklessness.
