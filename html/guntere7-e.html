<p>I have always been interested in the companionship spoken of by your kind.</p>
<P align=justify>It seems different than the human Blood Pledge of lord and follower, yet in many ways it seems similar. Elves always protect their human companion, but it can not be called service -- you do not hesitate to speak your mind to your human companion.</p>
<p>It might seem a bonded friendship of some kind, but even that seems an inadequate description.  Odd!</p>
