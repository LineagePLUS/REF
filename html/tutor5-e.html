<p>Hello, <username>.
<BR><BR>
I will explain hunting with PCs (Player Characters).
<BR><BR>
A hunting party is an informal group of players banded together to help each other kill monsters and gather treasure. To create a hunting party: 
<BR>
Shift-click at the feet of the PC to face the person you want to hunt with. 
<br>
Click on the community icon or type <b>/invite</b>. He or she will be asked if they want to join the party. 
<BR>
If they type Y and press Enter; they will be in your party and you will see a red line over your hunting partners. This is the health indicator for each player in the party - you can now tell whether or not a player in your party needs some help, or needs to regenerate HP. The person who starts the hunting party is the only person who may invite others to join. You may leave the hunting party at any time through use of the /outparty command. 
<BR><BR>
Party Conversation 
<BR><BR>
You can communicate exclusively with members of your hunting party, without being overheard by others. Party conversation is preceded by a number sign (#). For example: 
<BR><BR>
#Ogre heading your way!
