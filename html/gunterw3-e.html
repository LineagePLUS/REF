<p>It is said that the gods do their work through humans; that good deeds of humankind bring glory to Einhasad; bad deeds bring glory to Gran Kain...  And that fate, for good or evil, occurs through humankind.
<p>This is why one person can practice both black magic and white magic...  The gods react to the result, and do not coerce a course.
