<P>Is the one who is reading this the hero I was waiting for? Are you the one with the true courage to defeat the evil earth dragon Antharas, succeeding by will and hatred?</p>
<p>If you have the courage to answer the challenge, bring <font fg=ffffff>a drake's claw, a basilisk's horn, a crystal ball of necromancer, and an amulet of orc warrior</font> here as the day turns into the night - and then succeed in the quest that will be bestowed upon you by Cray.
<p>The names of those heroes who have overcome Cray's quest have been engraved herein.</p>
