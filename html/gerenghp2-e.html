<p>Have you ever heard about the Myth of the Two Gods? The magic we use channels the power of Einhasad, the Good God, and Gran Kain, the Evil God, to this world. In that sense, it's closer to being a miracle than magic. The reason Wizards from the Ivory Tower of Oren define this power as 'magic' despite the theory of a few mythologists is because the will of god is, in a cosmic sense, very inspecific - and thus no different from what we call the law of nature.</p>
<p>But of course there is an exception. Naturally the gods don't grant power to people who don't believe in them, or to those who live entirely by their own power, such as Knights.</p>
<br>
<p>Wizards consume a spiritual power called mana when casting a spell. Some people say the man with more mana is more pious, but that's not always true. All spells consume mana to some degree.</p>
<p>Some of the spells also drain the caster's physical power - you have to be careful when casting these spells since it could affect your body significantly.  Quite significantly, if it leaves you dead!</p>
