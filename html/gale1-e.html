One adventurer I met before boasted that he fought Fafurion alone at the bottom of the ocean. He said the duel was an even one, but who can believe that? Would you believe him? His claims were suspicious, so I am sure his words are false. He also says a toad-human is selling potions down in the water city. I cannot believe any of that either. Do you blame me?
