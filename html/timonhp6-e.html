<p>As Your Highness has defeated the Pretender King to become the King, there are still many groups within these lands that eye your position and wish to take Aden Castle to seize the power as their own. In order for Your Highness to remain King of Aden, you must deal wisely with the threats of these rebels.
<p>Having taken the castle, you must first adjust the tax rates in order to provide the funds needed to set right the internal security of the castle that collapsed during war. And, as the funds become available, you should hire Royal Guards in order to focus on strengthening the forces within the castle.
<p>Once crowned, you will be challenged by other Blood Pledges. Sieges against these Blood Pledges will take place at the time determined by Your Highness. After taking the castle, you must first tell me when you will have the next siege. That time may be freely changed for one half-day following the taking of the castle but if this time passes, it cannot be changed again. If you do not, within half a day, determine the time for starting the next siege, the siege will be scheduled automatically.
<p>Once the siege commences, Your Highness must defend the castle until sundown of the same day. Even if you lose the castle, as long as you recapture it before sundown, the castle will remain yours. And once you succeed in such a battle, you must decide on the time for the next siege. 
<br>
<p>However, sieges at Aden Castle take place in a form that is a little different than at other castles. At Aden Castle, there are five guard towers that protect the crown. The central Aden Guard Tower is not affected at all by attacks of anyone thanks to the divine protection of the four guard towers of Paagrio, Eva, Maphre and Sayha. 
<p>Enemies will naturally first aim for the four support guard towers with the names of the four gods. Of course, the collapse of the guard towers of the four gods will have no effect on the castle itself but after a certain amount of damage is caused to the support guard towers, the power of divine protection provided to the Aden Guard Tower will become weaker so that enemies can directly attack the Aden Guard Tower.
<p>Also, as I've said before, this castle does not have outer gates and the size of the castle is also very large. It will be necessary for the attackers and defenders both to plan a battle strategy that cannot be compared to other castles.
<p>I am being impertinent, but the defeated meets a rueful end. Your Highness, please handle these matters wisely.
