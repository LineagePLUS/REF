<p>Alchemy has unlimited possiblities for changing the world. But the research into the new alchemy requires unimaginable materials.</p>
<p>Wouldn't you like to help obtain the materials needed for this worthwhile research? If so, I could make you a Wizard's Cap or Wizard's Clothing as a favor. These are the latest in armor available for Wizards.  They are both light and powerful, no respectable Wizard should be without them.</p>
