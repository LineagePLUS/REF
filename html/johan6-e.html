<p>You look like you want to hand an item over to someone else. Then the first thing you need to do is press the <font fg=ffffff>Tab</font> key and open the Item Window.  Choose the item you wish to present there. It doesn't matter whether you want to give an item or adena. Anyway, choose an item and drag it over to the other person. For objects that can be counted, like adena, you need to decide on the quantity as well, but still the exchange procedure is this simple.
<br>
<p>Oh, one thing to remember is that the distance between you and the other person should not be too far. It's not like you are going to throw the items to him, is it? Do you understand?
