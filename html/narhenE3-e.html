<p>It's a flute made of oriharukon and bark of ent. All Elves can play a beautiful song with this; pans like the sound of this flute very much, so if you use it then they will come and ask to exchange it with <a link="narhenE6">a pan's horn</a>. The tone of this horn is very vibrant and can sometimes agitate other monsters, because they don't understand the music.

<p>I know how to make them, so I can make one if you bring me enough materials.</p>
