<p> In the end, the enemy of a Humans are Humans. No matter how strong a monster is, it cannot defeat the wisdom of a Human.<br><br> 
But if your opponent has the wisdom of a Human, the story changes. Since the Dark Elves who started this war have the same wisdom and strength as us Humans, this war may become the most difficult fight in the history of Aden.</p>
