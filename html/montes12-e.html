<p>That's good because as long as we have people like you, there is still hope in this world.
<p>Well, we've got three orders to carry out.
<p>The first is to guard Silent Cavern.
<p>The second is to seek cooperation from the Iron Gate Guild.
<p>The third order is to fight against the Lastabad army.
<p>After fulfilling these three missions, if you bring the required proof, I will give you a special gift. It may not be worth much, since this is war time, but it will be very useful to you.<p>
