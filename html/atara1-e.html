Land dragon Antharas, water dragon Fafurion and wind dragon Lindvior are known to everyone as the strongest and the most evil creatures alive. But the most powerful of the dragons, the fire dragon Valakas, dwells in that mountain. If he were to go on a rampage on a sudden whim, this town would be blown away in an instant along with the Iron Gate.
