<p>Yoo-hoo! Do you see my name in a blood-red color? Ha, ha, ha. Some old bores insist you must act in virtuous manner only, but what's the fun in that? The strongest is best! Citizen, domestic animal or good monster -- who cares? Get rid of them all! Well, there are a few disadvantages, like the security guards attacking you, or being unable to use most of the shops...but you will be thrilled with a feeling beyond those minor details! May the strongest rise!
