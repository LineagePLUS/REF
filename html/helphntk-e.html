<font fg=ffffff><p align=center>Hints &amp; Tips: Knight</p></font>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Background:</font>
<p>Knights are characters who have heard rumors about the undefeated Gunter and aspire to find their own path to lead them to honor and glory. A Knight seeks to hone his abilities to the limit, and to find and serve a lord who will acknowledge the Knight's worth. </p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Starting location:</font>
<p>Knights start game play in Hidden Valley.  Or, if you're not too shy, you can have Illdrath teleport you to Silver Knight Town for your training.  Some Knights choose to head to Talking Island to go to the academy for Knights, run by Gunter, a respected and wise Knight in Aden.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Early in the game:</font>
<p>A Knight must not only follow the chivalric code, but also become strong in combat. Therefore, it's recommended that you either concentrate on the training dummies until level four or try your hand at defeating monsters near the village and obtaining experience points and items.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Basic equipment:</font>
<p>A Knight starts the game with a dagger, leather jacket, and two candles. The dagger and jacket may be wielded/worn by clicking on the appropriate item within the Item Window. The Item Window is shown by pressing the Tab key or clicking on the <font fg=ffffff>bag icon</font><img src="#29"> on the right side of the Chat Window.
<p>Candles are used to provide illumination at night. To use a candle, click on the candle icon within the equipment window. Candles are expended after being used for some time.
<p>You may drop items when killed by monsters or other characters, so be careful.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>People to meet:</font>
<p> Belgeter: He welcomes you to Hidden Valley, as a new player, and shows you the basics for playing the game. 
<p> Fraoun: A merchant in Hidden Valley. Almost everything you need can be purchased from him. He can be found in the eastern part of town.
</p>Healer: There are various healers around town in Hidden Valley that can restore your hit points (HP) when they are low. 
<br>
<p> Gunter : The instructor at the academy for Knights on the Talking Island. He will explain current events and tell you what tasks you must perform. His house, a cavern dug out of a rocky mountain, is located west of the village.
<p> Gereng: A magician on the Talking Island. His house is located southeast of the village.
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Places to go:</font>
<p> Training  area: Located south of town in the Hidden Valley.
<p> Outside of town in Hidden Valley:  There are numerous low level monsters around town to challenge your ability as a beginner Knight.
<p> Silver Knight Town: This is a great place to find higher level Knights to learn from.  YOu mustn't be shy, speak up and meet new people.  There are also a variety of monsters around the town that need slaying. Help liberate the town and level up at the same time!
<p> Arena: Located south of the Talking Island village, the Arena is the only place Gunter allows duels between characters. Here, characters may fight without worrying about items or experience points.
<p> Training  ground: This place, located southwest of Gunter's house, was made by Gunter to train characters without many real-life combat experiences. If you think the monsters near the village are too powerful, then you can obtain experience points in this relatively safe environment.
