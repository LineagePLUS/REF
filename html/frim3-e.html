Huh? You want to know what black mithril ore is?
<br>
If what you bring everyday from the miner Oums isn't black mithril ore, what in the world do you think it is? The reason I came here is to refine it into black mithril...
<br>
Whew! You... you're not going to ask me again what ingredients are required to refine this into black mithril, are you?
<br>
Oh my... Did you forget again?
<br>
Good golly... You ask me the same stupid questions everyday and I'm rather tired of it.
<br>
OK, I'm going to tell you just one more time so write it down somewhere, would you?
<br>
In order to refine black mithril ore into black mithril, you'll need 1 blob gastric juice, 1 volcanic ash, 1 black spirit stone and 5 black mithril ores.
