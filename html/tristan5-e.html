Ah, yes, Laia.... She casts forth terror with her power of elemental curse that emanates from the darkness. The Dark Elves call her the sorceress of nightmares. Her unshaking cool and bravado, coupled with her amazing sense of observation, are breathtaking. She will not suffer fugitives from the land... On this matter I agree with her.
<br>
Of course, the forces of the land now draw near, but I believe that Laia will hold her own...
