Though it will not happen often, be careful when you fight underwater. Among the most troublesome monsters is the <font fg=ffffff>aste</font>. Normally, you cannot even spot it because it hides in the sand. Then out of nowhere, it springs and attacks. The ast can cause paralysis -- so be extra careful. Not being able to move underwater...goodness, isn't just the thought of that enough to make you shudder?
