At level 5 a Prince/Princess can create a Blood Pledge. This is a group of players that work together in support of common goals. Eventually, you may choose to join in a Castle siege.
<br><br>
To create a Blood Pledge simply type:<br>
/create <font fg=ffffff>YourBloodPledgeName</font>
<br>
You can also use the Community Option window under Blood Pledge Options.
<br><br>
Of course, you should decide your own pledge name.
<br><br>
To join a Blood Pledge, you must first find a Prince/Princess that is recruiting members. This part is easy--Just ask!
<br>
Now you and the Prince/Princess should face each other and the player should type /join. The Prince/Princess will be prompted to accept or decline.
