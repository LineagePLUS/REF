<P>Did you know that you can set your function keys to perform many actions, such as drinking a potion?</P>
<P>Its quite easy. Simply open your inventory item by clicking on the bag icon on the lower right of your screen.</P>
<P>Then click, hold, and drag the item to one of the empty boxes in the lower right. If you drag the item to the F5 slot, you can activate that item by pressing F5 on your keyboard.</P>
<P>Imagine being in a battle with a vicious orc. You can consume a healing potion in the middle of the fight. You should also consider adding a teleport scroll to one of your function keys if you need to escape from danger.</P>
