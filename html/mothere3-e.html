<p>Young Elves call me Mother of the Forest and Elves.</p>
<p>...This gives me a strange feeling. Even though I'm clearly a <a link="mothere6">part of the World Tree</a> right now, once I was just one of the Elves whom you call the "first ancestors". As the Mother Tree, I'm the mother of you all; but as an Elf, all I did was raise two sons.
