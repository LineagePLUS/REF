<p>You want my wing? Hmpf, of course you do, my wing is very beautiful. It's natural that you covet it.  I can always make another, so I suppose it doesn't really matter.
<br>But do you know this? It is a collection of elemental energy which can be used to go to the elemental plane. But you Elves just use our beautiful wings to coat mithril and make weapons...awful!
<br>However, I do need new garments, I suppose, so some good may come of it. If you can give me five <font fg=ffffff>mithril threads</font> and 40 pieces of <font fg=ffffff>fairy dust</font>, I'm willing to part with it. I will look beautiful at the next fairy festival! Hee hee!
