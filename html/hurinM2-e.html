<p>It's still a mystery to me as to how you could avoid the guardians...but I suspect that you have seen them already.
Arachne, pan, ent, and fairy are the guardians of the forest, and they hate intruders - especially humans. They are afraid that your arrogance and desire to take over the world may consume the last resting place of Elves.

You may see all monsters as things to hunt, but you'd better be careful about the guardians - they are created by Einhasad Herself to protect the forest and Elves.
