of evolution... If you feed it to your pet the most amazing evolution will 
occur... <br> I once bought some from an adventurer on his way to Talking 
Island. He warned me not to feed it to a pet that is below a certain level. <br> 
If the pet is too young, the fruit could kill it. <br> <br> <a link="ryumiel5a">Sell the fruit of evolution.</a><br> <a link="ryumiel5b">What 
happens when a human eats it?</a><br> </body>
