<p>Old Blu has sent me another useless task!</p>
<p>What's the point of explaining how to make those unbelievable weapons of legend when inadequate inquirers can't even bring the ingredients?</p>
<p>The items required are an assassin's rusted sword, a dark star and fungus poison.</p>
<p>Even if you can get the other items, the assassin's rusted sword will likely be beyond you. Since it's a sword that was made to fight dragons, it is something that most people don't even get to see in their entire lifetimes.</p>
<br>
<p>Well, anyway, if you need more details about it, go find Roje! A blacksmith like me doing business in such an out-of-the-way place just doesn't have clear information about such things.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Roje is an honest fellow who isn't deviant like me and so he might not welcome a Dark Elf such as yourself. Hee, hee, hee.</p>
<br>
<p>Ah, and it might be useful for you to know that he used to be a Human assassin but was betrayed by the Assassin Master who was their leader and was kicked out of their guild.</p>
<p>Although he was a Human assassin, he's the only fellow that I know of to have had a close relationship with us Dark Elves.</p>
<p>Blu is always thinking about the Roje of the past, that unfortunate fellow.</p>
