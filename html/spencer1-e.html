If you make a small donation to the Temple of Eva, the goddess of water, she will create a potion for you called the <font fg=ffffff>Blessing of Eva</font>. I have no idea how it is made but it allows you to breathe underwater -- a major necessity in Heine. You may need it at some time in the future, so remember this well.
