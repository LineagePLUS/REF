<p>You can't win a war just by prevailing in numbers; even an excellent warrior is helpless without the right equipment to allow him to fully demonstrate his abilities.
<p>There is something I'd like you to help me with. I want you to obtain the letter of treaty from the Iron Gate Guild. They are the best blacksmiths and with their superior tempering skills, our combat capability will improve several times over.
<p>According to our sources, the Dwarves are also engaged in a desperate battle against the Lastabad army. But it appears that they're more interested in a recently discovered thing called black mithril than in the battle with Lastabad itself.
<p>According to a colleague who visited and offered them black mithril, he was able to obtain their promise to make something for him. I hope you will also be successful in obtaining good results from them! 
<p>Go quickly to the Iron Gate Guild, meet with the Dwarven commander and bring me back their letter of treaty signifying cooperation.
