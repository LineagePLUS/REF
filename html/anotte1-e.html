<p>This town is up to its eyeballs in wannabe Knights. Whew - I should leave this place as soon as possible... though Lord Gerard is quite nice. If you want to be a Knight, you should take him as your example.</p>
<br>
<p>Are you looking for Lord Gerard? He lives north of the town.<br><br>
Um... But, Lord Gerard seems to have a lot on his mind these days because of the invasion of the Dark Elves. It is said that they just appeared right out of the ground... How in the world could that happen?
