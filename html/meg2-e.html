<P>The Pretender King, Ken Rauhel, is served by Kerenis, a black Wizard.  </p> 
<P>Kerenis is like a physical extension of the Pretender King.  On the order of the Ken Rauhel, Kerenis used black magic to steal the souls of people. Because of that, many Princes - including my own Prince -- and soldiers lost their souls.  </p> 
<P>Even now, when you pass by the border fortress of Elmore, you can see such beings wandering around without their souls. You are the one Richard mentioned who is looking for the Emblem of the Royal Family.  Hmm...  I used to be in charge of guarding it but it was destroyed by the Pretender King.  But, don't discourage... Although I don't have the whole Emblem, I do have one piece of it.  However, since this Emblem Piece of the Royal Family is treasured by those who are resisting the Pretender King's forces, I will not turn it over to you lightly. So...  If you can prove to me your firm determination to challenge the Pretender King's forces, then - and only then - will I give you the Emblem Piece. As you know, many people have lost their souls because of Kerenis, the Pretender King's Wizard.  If you can help me to liberate the souls taken by Kerenis, I will gladly give you the Emblem you desire.</p> 
<P>In order to set free those who have been robbed of their souls, you have to get help from two white Wizards in the Ice Dungeon, not far from Ivory Tower Town. I wish you luck and will await your return.</p>
