<p>This is a magic training room where the essense of the temples, where Wizards travel to learn spells, is reproduced. This way, they can learn spells here and not have to travel so far.
<p>Did you see the spirit magic training room for the Elves on the lower level? Similar to that room, this room was built to recreate the powers of the temple so you could learn the spells of the magic books without having to visit the temple in person. 
<p>I have just one word of caution for you. At our Ivory Tower, experiments in black magic are also being carried out, so that kind of magic does exist here. But you cannot learn chaotic magic in this training room.
<p>The only kind of magic that you may practice here is neutral magic. Please be sure about the nature of the magic which you intend to learn before you come in.
