<p>You've heard about the Dark Elves in Silent Cavern, right?
<p>Unlike the Dark Elves from underground, they interact with us Humans.
<p>Unfortunately, relations with them are terribly strained now due to a misjudgement we made a long time ago.
<p>We deceived them and carried out the test of the Knights of Aden, which we never should have done.
<p>We thought that they would not willingly go along with us, so we stole their luminous stone pieces. After they discovered our scheme, they're no longer on speaking terms with us.
<p>If you would like to help me, go see the chief of Kan's guards and find out how we can persuade them.
<p>I guess fate isn't totally against us, it seems as though they also are in need of some help from the outside.
<p>Due to a thing called Lastabad's Eye, the security of the Dark Elves has been compromised. If we can help them in this difficult time, they might just be willing to give us another chance.
<p>No matter how much their attitude may make you uncomfortable, do not show your true feelings to them. If you do, perhaps you will encounter an even bigger trial.
