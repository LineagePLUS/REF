<p>Animal Tournament is the game in which your animal will fight another's animal.
<p>A player registers his animal and waits until a challenger arrives... The two attendees bet the same money, and the winner takes all.
<p>Giving items or casting spells before the game is alright, but you'd better not use really expensive items if the price will exceed the winning prize.

<p>...one man from Oren said that the fights were disgusting, and asked how could we make our pets fight against each other.
<p>Bah, he doesn't understand we just do this for amusement and some petty cash while avoiding our <a link="helpdog2">noble mistress</a>...
