<P>How are you? I am Detector the White Wizard. But people call me a black wizard.<br>
Though it's true that I work on unsealing the spells cast on artifacts filled with secrets from the past, it's very unfortunate that I've gotten the title of Black Wizard!</p>
<P>Did you come seeking my help because you are interested in the ancient inheritance that is supposedly hidden on Forgotten Island?</p>
