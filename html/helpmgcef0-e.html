<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Terminology:</font>
<br>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Caster</font>: The person who is casting a magic spell.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Magic Level of the Caster</font>: The level of magic the caster is learning and can use at present. One's magic level is closely related to one's character level and only Elves can learn spirit magic. Spirit magic levels range from one to five.</p>
<p>The magic for each level can be learned at a level multiplied by 10. (i.e., level 10, level 20, level 30, level 40, level 50).</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Target</font>: All spells need one or more targets. Unless the proper target is designated, the spell will not function correctly. Magic targets can be:
<p> - Caster: The PC who casts the spell 
<p> - PC: Specific players in the current screen 
<p> - NPC: Monsters in the present screen
<p> - Pledge member: All on-screen members of the caster's pledge 
<p> - Enemy: An on-screen monster or member of an enemy pledge (during castle sieges) 
<p> - Item: An item held by the caster 
<p> - Location: Usually a given spot on the screen.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Ingredients:</font>
<p>Some spirit magic spells require magic ingredients to work and such ingredients are called "spirit gems." The number of spirit gems required for each spell is specified in the the HELP section.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Specialization:</font>
<p>After reaching level 30, an Elf can choose a line of magic through Ellyonne who is located in the Ivory Tower of Oren.</p>
<p>As a Wizard uses the spellbooks, an Elf uses items called spirit crystals to learn magic. Similarly, as a Wizard must go to the appropriate temple in order to learn the content of the spellbooks, an Elf needs to visit the Mother Tree.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Lines:</font>
<p>The Common Line of magic is available to every Elf. After that, an Elf can choose the Line of Fire, Line of Water, Line of Wind or Line of Earth.</p>
<p>Only one line of magic (besides the Common Line) may be chosen and learned. Once an Elf masters one line of magic, they cannot learn any additional lines.</p>
<p>If an Elf wishes to learn a line of magic that is different than what he or she has already mastered, that Elf must rid himself or herself of the magical powers of that line -- all but the most basic skills.</p>
<p>In the same way as when choosing a specialization, an Elf must go to Ellyonne to rid himself or herself of a particular line of magic. However, although one may rid oneslef of the magical powers through Ellyonne, an Elf cannot remove the powers of summon lesser elemental magic from oneself.</p>
