<p>The fighting occurs not far from the mainland port, so I sometimes get to see some gruesome battles. The bodies of the dead are left on the battlefeild to rot; no one removes the bodies or buries them, for fear of angering the Pretender King...of course, battles even happen here sometimes with ruffians attempting to prey on the weak.</p>
