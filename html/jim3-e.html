<p>I took on this appearance because of my stupid greed. You've seen the Chaotic Temple, right?  Well... I tried to steal the Jewel of Red Light, that dazzling and brilliant magic stone that mesmerizes all who go there.  You've been tempted by greed before haven't you?  I'm only human and I couldn't resist. How stupid... As a result, I was cursed by the Chaotic Temple and changed into this monster shape. I have not lost my human nature thanks to help from Sir Orim but I can't just live with this appearance forever and I despair greatly. From what I've heard, I can be released from the curse with a Potion of Revival given by a true Red Knight,  But... that potion is given only once to each Red Knight... who would sacrifice their life and give it to me?
