<p>You can obtain meat by hunting monsters and animals. Would you like to know how meat is used? Well, meat should be eaten. No matter how brave and courageous an adventurer you are, you cannot exert strength if your stomach is growling, huh?
<br>
<p>There are several disadvantages to having an empty stomach.  Not only will you be unable to <font fg=ffffff>shout</font> or hear those shouting, you also won't be able to regenerate mana or hit points properly. 
<p>Under normal circumstances, you will not become especially hungry, nor are you even required to consume meat. The exceptions to this are if you are killed, your food gauge resets to zero and if you use the shout function, your food gauge will gradually decrease.
<br>
<p>Another function for meat is to use it as a means to tame wild animals.  Have you seen other adventurers walking about with dogs by their side? They are people who, just as I mentioned, tamed the animals with meat and domesticated them as their personal pets.
