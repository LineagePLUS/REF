<p>Have you been higher up than the sixth floor of this Ivory Tower?
<p>Monsters set free from the magical bonds... Their powers are much greater than what normal people can imagine.
<p>The demon on the eighth and top floor of the tower has especially tremendous power.
<p>You see... several years back, there was one knight who defeated the demon and brought back the demon's armor. 
<p>That was some amazing armor! According to a rumor I heard, there is a way of getting your hands on other demon armor too -- although this is very rare. 
<p>What do you suppose will happen if somebody collects a full suit of demon armor? People predict that such a person will acquire all of the demon's enormous powers. 
<p>Do you think the person would receive only the demon's strength? I wonder. Perhaps the user's mind would turn into a demon as well?
