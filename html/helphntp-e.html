<font fg=ffffff><p align=center>Hints &amp; Tips: Prince/Princess</p></font>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Background:</font>
<p>Prince and Princess characters are those of royal blood, but who are denied their heritage by the Pretender King. To defeat the Pretender King and claim your birthright, your character must defeat monsters to obtain wealth and power...and to gather blood brothers loyal to your cause.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Starting location:</font>
<p>Prince/Princess characters start play at the village on Singing Island. Your character's place of birth is the Kingdom of Aden, located across the sea. You have traveled to this island for training and to elude the Pretender King's forces. </p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Early in the game:</font>
<p>Honing one's combat abilities is the first step for a Prince/Princess to take in attempting to reclaim the throne. Therefore, early in the game, a Prince/Princess must concentrate on defeating monsters around the village to receive experience points and items, and then seek out more powerful monsters.  Also, until you reach level four, the training ground to the west of town is an excellent place to gain experience.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Basic equipment:</font>
<p>A Prince/Princess starts the game with a dagger, a leather jacket, and two candles. The dagger and jacket may be used by clicking on the appropriate item within the Item Window. The Item Window is shown by pressing the Tab key or clicking on the <font fg=ffffff>bag icon</font><img src="#29"> to the right side of the Chat Window.
<p>Candles are used to provide illumination at night. To use a candle, click on the candle icon within the Item Window. Candles burn out after being used for some time.
<p>You may drop items when killed by monsters or other characters, so be careful.</p>

<font fg=ffffaf>People to meet:</font>
<p> Luder: He welcomes you to the Singing Island, as a new player, and shows you the basics for playing the game. 
<p> Johan: A merchant in the Singing Island. Almost everything you need can be purchased from him. He can be found in the southern part of town.
</p>Healer: There are various healers around town in Singing Island who can restore your hit points (HP) when they are low. 
<p> Gunter: The instructor at the academy for Knights on Talking Island. He will explain current events and tell you what tasks you must perform. His house, a cavern dug out of a rocky mountain, is located west of the village.
<p> Gereng: A magician on the Talking Island. His house is located southeast of the village.
<p> Pandora: A merchant on Talking Island. Almost everything you need can be bought from her. You can meet Pandora near the docks northeast of the village.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Places to go:</font>
<p> Training  area: Located west of town on Singing Island.
<p> Outside of town on Singing Island:  There are numerous low level monsters around town to challenge your ability as a beginner Prince or Princess.
<p> Talking Island: This is a great place to find higher level players to play with and learn from.  YOu mustn't be shy, speak up and meet new people.  There are also a variety of monsters around the village that need slaying. Help liberate the village and level up at the same time!
<p> Arena: Located south of the Talking Island village, the arena is the only place Gunter allows duels between characters. Here, characters may fight without worrying about items or experience points.
<p> Training  ground on Talking Island: This place, located southwest of Gunter's house, was made by Gunter to train characters without many real-life combat experiences. If you think the monsters near the village are too powerful, then you can obtain experience points in this relatively safe environment.
