<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Mother of the Forest and Elves:</p></font>
<br>
<p>Nerupa is one of the oldest living guardians. Unlike us, guardians' lives are finite. To other beings, their life spans might seem pretty "infinite"...but they are not.</p>
<p>When she was young, Nerupa was a great warrior and the best artisan in the forest. If there is <font fg=ffffff>something you want to make</font>, go underground to meet her -- you can follow the <font fg=ffffff>entrance beside me </font>.</p>
