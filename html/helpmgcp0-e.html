<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Explanation of Magic Terminology:</font>
<br>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Caster</font>: The person casting a spell.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>Spell Level of the Caster</font>: This number indicates the highest level of spells the caster can learn and use. Spell level has a strong relationship with a player's general level. Prince/Princess magic is something that only a Prince/Princess can learn and it exists for Levels 1 through 3.</p>
<p><font fg=ffffff>There is also an upper spell limit.
<p><font fg=ffffff>The magic of each level is as follows: Level 1 - Prince/Princess Magic: character level of 15 required; Level 2 - Prince/Princess Magic: character level of 30 required; Level 3 - Prince/Princess Magic: character level of 50 required.
<p><font fg=ffffff>Target of Magic</font>: Every spell has its own possible target. If the correct target is not designated, the spell won't work properly. The following are the possible targets of magic. 
<p> - Caster: It only affects the caster that is using the magic. 
<p> - PC: It affects a PC on the screen. 
<p> - NPC: It affects a monster on the screen. 
<p> - Blood Pledge Member: It affects a PC or PCs on the current screen belonging to the same Blood Pledge as the caster.
<p> - Enemy: It affects a monster or PC of a Blood Pledge on the current screen that is at war with the caster's pledge.
<p> - Item: It affects an item that the caster is carrying. 
<p> - Location: It usually affects a single point on the screen.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Ingredients: </font>
<p>In order to cast some spells, magic gems are needed. The required number is specified in the help screen for each spell.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Learning Magic: </font>
<p>The spells of Level 2 or below may be purchased with adena from Wizard NPCs located at designated places. On the Talking Island, players can learn from Gereng who lives on the east side of the island. Of course, one must be at a high enough level to learn the spells. 
<p>To obtain the magic of Level 3 or higher, one must go to NPCs or monsters related to quests which are located at designated places. Such magic can then be learned by going to the temple and following the rituals for the respective magic.
