<p>Oh my! How unfortunate that you say you want to cancel your registration. I'll be sorry to see you go.
<p>You may already know this but when you cancel your village registration, you must wait one month before you can register in a new village. Also, you cannot receive any benefits from the residents of the village for the recent period and when you register newly after a month you'll need to pay the registration fee again as a village resident.
<p>So, do you still want to cancel your registration?
<p>For your reference, today is: <date>.</p>
