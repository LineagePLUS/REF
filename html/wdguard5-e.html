<p>Since you are not from around here, you wouldn't know...the Gludin towns used to bustle with life as trade harbors, and now the only people that wander around are people bearing arms. In the northern woods, people who have lost their farmland during the recent war, gather around forming small camps on burnt-down grounds, living like refugees.
<p>I am not a man of politics, but observing the sentiments of the people and knowing what goes on around here, there has got to be something wrong going on... This weighs heavily on my mind.
