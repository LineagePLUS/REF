<p>There are a total of ten levels of magic. First level magic involves simple cantrips: making your staff shine, or making light wounds close.  High-level spells are far, far more powerful than that -- but those spells are not for everyone. Seventh level or higher spells can be learned only by professional Wizards. Elves who are innately good at magic because of their elemental nature can learn spells up to level six. Princes or Princesses who but dabble in the arts can only learn up to level two.</p>
<p>In addition to the limits on total power, there is also a difference in the rate of learning.  Wizards can learn the first level spells at level four and get an opportunity to learn the next level of spells every four levels thereafter.  Elves, on the other hand, can learn their first level spells at level eight.  They move to the next magic level after gaining eight levels of power. Those of royal blood can only learn first level spells at level ten, and second at level 20.</p>
<p>I can teach you, but I am limited to third level spells...in fact, even Wizards with more power than I can't really 'teach' fourth level or higher spells.  For some things, a Wizard must prove themselves worthy by their own research.  You can only learn higher level spells by acquiring spellbooks, and then visiting the temples around the world and performing an appropriate ritual. There, the gods will tell you how you can learn the spells.
