<br>Hail <username>!
<p>The first thing you should do is equip your weapon and armor. 
<br><br>
To do this, open your inventory by pressing the Tab key or click the bag icon in the Menu bar to view your inventory.
<br>Find the icon for the weapon you wish to arm yourself with.
<br>Double-click the icon. Note that it will indicate that the weapon is armed when you put your cursor over the icon in the inventory. 
<br>If you double-click the icon again, you will disarm. Use these steps to put on or take off your armor, as well.
<br><br>
