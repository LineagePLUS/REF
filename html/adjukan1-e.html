<p>There is something about you...
<p>You don't smell right. State your business. What do you want from me? You must be from above ground. Although you look like a Dark Elf, I don't trust you. A Dark Elf who has been exposed to the light above ground is no longer true to his kin! But... perhaps you're one of those cunning Dark Elves from the underground? We are committed in our conviction to darkness!
<p>Why are you staring at me like that? You have the eyes of a narrow-minded fool. If you're not careful, I'll gouge them out of your head!
<p>I'm not in a good mood right now, so don't try my patience. The nerves in my body are as sharp as my finger nails!
