<p>Hmm... Looking at you, I'd say you are working to become an Aden Knight. But I don't think this is a job to be done only by Aden Knight aspirants. The threat to the peace of Aden is a threat to the land and anyone that lives on the land should step forward without hesitation. So it's not important to me whether you are an Aden Knight or not.
<br>
<p>I'm sure you know that creatures that threaten the peace of Aden are continuously appearing. In the past, the strength of those creatures was not such a big problem but a powerful force has appeared that can join with and control them. This means that even though one of these creatures is nothing special on its own, their power becomes remarkable from the moment that they are unified with this force. I don't know too much about that power but the creatures are known collectively as the Shadow of Jejeo.
<br>
That's why we've formed a band of fighters called Aden Knights. In the name of righteousness and in order to maintain peace in the Kingdom of Aden, we've made some items called Coins of Aden to represent the Knights. There is one problem though... The Coins of Aden were stolen from me when I was transporting them... Oh, how unfortunate!
<br>
So what I'm trying to say is that it would be great if you would help in recovering the coins that have been lost. 
These Coins of Aden are more valuable to us in terms of their sentimental significance than their physical worth.
As Monte has said, these items represent our endeavor to walk the path of righteousness.
<br>
Ah, and I don't know if this will help or not but the creature that took the Coins of Aden was a dark wizard who is said to be able to turn matter into any form he wants. When that strange dark wizard cast some bizarre spell on the Coins of Aden, they were turned into monsters.
