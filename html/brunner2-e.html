<p>Karel, the Blue Knight of Betrayal, is the one...but I don't know how he got such a name. It is said that when humans had not yet reached Windawood and it was only inhabited by monsters, Lord Karel -- with his best Knights -- invaded a dark lair of monsters and built the castle over the dungeon to seal the evil creatures within. </p>
<br>
<p>Even then, Windawood, a naturally barren field, was nearly uninhabitable - but at least then there was the ambition to make it a rich land. I miss the old days. And now with the war, Gludin has been turned into a desolate village.</p>
