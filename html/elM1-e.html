You ... are, perhaps, human?
<br>
Amazing! I've never seen a human before. You are the kind who is supposed to blaze through the long night like a falling star?  'Tis a rare thing to see a human in the Elven Town.
<br>
Beware, for the elders don't like humans very much, and the guardians will attack you.  I like humans, though -
even though your lives are short, you consume your life force, living your life to the fullest.  It, I think, is exactly the force that has made you the owners of the world. Even we haughty Elves must be envious, and perhaps that's why they are forming relationships with humans in the outside.
<br>
I'd love to hear more about the outside from you, but I'm so busy with my work.  What must it be like to have your life be so fleeting?  If only I could go to the outside world!
