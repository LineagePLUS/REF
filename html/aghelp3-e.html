</P><p>
If <font fg=ffffff>Sell House</font> is selected, the house is immediately registered for auction. At this time, you can decide the starting auction price.  The highest bidder wins the auction.  <BR> After the auction closes, the money remaining after deducting taxes is automatically sent to your Item Box with a letter. However, be particularly careful because you lose ownership of the house at the same time it is registered for auction. <BR> If, at the auction's closing time, there is no one willing to pay the starting price you proposed, the house reverts back to your ownership. Therefore, it is best not to set a price that is too high. <BR>
