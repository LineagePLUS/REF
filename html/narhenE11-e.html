<p>You can ask <a link="narhenE7">arachnes</a> to make pan's mane into thread. The threads from a pan's mane are very soft yet tough -- it's the essential material for <a link="narhenE9">Nerupa</a> to make bows, clothes, cloaks, and other things. You can collect them using your bare hands by stroking their mane, but they can become violent if you cause them pain. So be very careful when collecting them.
