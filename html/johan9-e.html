<p>As much as a weapon's purpose is to make an enemy fall in the shortest possible time and with the greatest efficacy, the objective of armor is to protect you from the enemy's attack. You could say it is the most important element for maintaining your life. If, in the unfortunate event you are stricken to the ground, you could lose your valuable items or be relieved of experience you spent a long time accumulating.
<br>
<p>As with weapons, just <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> the Item Window to equip yourself with or to relieve yourself of your armor. There are a few limitations in the use of weapons and armor that you should be aware of. For example, if you are holding a two-handed weapon, you cannot hold a shield at the same time. And you can only equip yourself with armor by putting them on in the following order: <font fg=ffffff>clothing, armor and cloak</font>. If you think about it a moment, you'll see that this makes perfect sense.  After all, you cannot wear clothes over your armor or put armor over a cloak, now can you? Conversely, when you take this attire off, you have to remove the cloak first or else you won't be able to take off your armor or clothing.
