<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Magician Siriss:</p></font> 
<br>
<p>Simply put, magic can be summed up as the acts of big and small <font fg=ffffff>miracles </font>achieved by borrowing the power of the gods. Divided roughly, there are two categories: <font fg=ffffff>the white magic of the good god Einhasad, </font>and <font fg=ffffff>the black magic of the evil god Gran Kain.</font> Now, that is really simplifying the issue enormously, so if you want to learn in more detail about these complex magical theories, you had better ask <font fg=ffffff>Sir Gereng of the Talking Island.</font> In any case, if you are a Knight who bets everything on the sword or are a person who does not acknowledge the existence of the gods, you can neither learn nor use magic.
