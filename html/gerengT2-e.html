<p>My research has nearly reached completion, but I still need one more item. A Bone of Undead holds the soul of an undead and is an essential item to finish my research... To get this Bone of Undead, you would normally have had to kill a Death Knight who is the mightiest of all the undead. However, don't be discouraged. Long ago, there was a devious undead who took the Bone of Undead from a Death Knight who was preparing to resurrect himself. That fool ran off with the Bone of Undead and is now hiding in a dungeon somewhere to the northwest. You can get additional help if you go meet my understudy Dilong who is there. And, if you bring me back this Bone of Undead, I will make you something that is essential for a Wizard.
