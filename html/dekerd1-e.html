<p>Welcome to the Ivory Tower Town! Isn't it an interesting name? To be honest, we don't really have any official name for our town.</p>
<p>The merchants who brought magical goods from the Ivory Tower to sell all over the world pitched tents here -- just to spend a few nights close to the tower. But more and more came and the tents ended up growing into the town you see. 
<p>So, we all came to call this area the Ivory Tower Town.
