<p>I think you know well how dangerous the current situation is. If you want to keep in business with us for long, you have to protect the fortress from the threat of other humans, including those from the burnt fields.
<p>If you want to keep us under control, you should get the adena from the slime race as soon as possible. But if you take too much, some race addicts may get mad, so you'd better be careful.
<p>Once you take over the fortress, other pledges will try to take it from you. For them, you have to set the next siege time. You can set the time through me. Your competitors can challenge you after the time you set, and if you don't set the next siege time before half of the day passes after you took over the fortress, the time will be set to approximately 10 days later.
<p>As soon as the siege begins, you have to protect the fortress until sunset. This fortress will be safely yours again till the next siege time, if you have the fortress at sunset.
<br>
<p>Our fortress is designed to repel enemies at the outer gate, so remember that once it is penetrated, the fortress as a whole will be in danger. Of course, you must not die either, so you'd better keep sufficient warriors at your side.
<p>If you are killed by the challenging pledge members, or this throne is taken...then the fortress will be in their hands. I hope that this won't happen, but I've seen it before.
