<p> If you go directly south from this village, there is Heine, a beautiful city surrounded by forests and lakes. I'd like to leave this dreary city and live in that kind of a place... <br><br>
And even further from there, Gludin has been destroyed by the Dark Elven army. I sure hope that the city of water, Heine, isn't affected by that. <br>
From what I've heard, an Aden protection force has been formed to fight against them and I'm sure that even the brave youngsters from Heine are stepping forth to support.
