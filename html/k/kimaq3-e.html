<p>Ah... So that's what happened! That's what happened!</p>
<p>I guess I was just walking around in oblivion trying to reach a light called darkness...</p>
<p>Have I ended up with a soul that teeters between light and dark?!</p> 
<p>Ha, ha, ha. With enough time, we can find out anything. I... I have faith.</p>
<br>
<p>Ok, a promise is a promise so I'll do what I said. I don't speak false words or commit false actions like Bludika.</p>
<p>If you use the "Mask of Truth" that I've given you, you'll be able to see the true appearance of things.</p>
<p>If you use the it in a land barren of souls, you'll be able to see the true appearance of that place. And you'll be able to find the thing that you are looking for.</p>
