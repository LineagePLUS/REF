<p>If you go south from here you'll find the famous Forest of Mirrors, a vast and dense thicket. Although Aden and Heine are nearby geographically, the main reason that the movement of goods is not by land but rather by sea is because of the Doppelgangers that live there in the forest.
<br><br>
The scary thing about this monster is not the violence or aggression of the evil beast itself but that one never knows when or where such a monster will take on the appearance of a friend.
<br><br>
No, in fact, even that isn't necessarily so awful. The worst thing, I guess, is that the monsters in that forest can take on one's very own appearance...<br>
The reason I'm telling you this is that I heard a very strange story recently. Perhaps this is something you've already heard from another adventurer that passed by here... Anyway, he said he saw a monster in the Forest of Mirrors that was different than an ordinary Doppelganger. But still, it's better than the Dark Elven gangs that are causing fear in the whole world these days.</p><br>
