<p>Hmm... Are you an adventurer? My name is Kreister and I am chief apprentice to Master Talass, the highest elder of the Ivory Tower.
<p>The youngster Varyeth speaks about strange things, but he has no idea what he is saying. There is no way such an immature kid can inherit the Ivory Tower, is there?
<p>Now, I do not mean to say that I will follow in the great Talass's footsteps, so don't misunderstand me.
<p>What is important is that Varyeth always puts on a good face, but he is not the type of person the Ivory Tower truly needs.
<p>He is either an intolerable hypocrite or a complete fool. Do you really believe that Varyeth is studying magic for the good of the Ivory Tower?
<br>
<p>...Talking about Varyeth is giving me a headache and has put me in a bad mood!
<p>So, what brings you here?
<p>My main area of specialty is magic used in supporting roles -- not the type of magic with nothing more than a fancy-schmancy appearance, but wholesome magic that is truly useful.
<p>Well, do you see anything you need?
