<p>A land barren of souls means a place where nothing can live.</p>
<p>Just as there is the intangible thing called darkness if there is the intangible thing called light, so the tangible thing which light shines on is also the tangible thing of darkness.</p>
<p>If you go to the place where the tangibles of darkness exist, you will understand.</p>
<br>
<p>And I'd like to tell you one last fact.</p>
<p>The "Dark Star" of which Bludika spoke has extreme powers of destruction and you should know that there are others that want it also.</p>
<p>You'll find out with time whether Bludika is presenting an upright path but I already know from your actions that you are walking along a path of righteousness.</p>
