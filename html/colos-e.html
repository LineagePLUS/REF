How do you do? A Deathmatch is taking place here at the Coliseum. Games are held at set intervals during the day and the participation fee is 1000 adena per contestant. Please keep in mind that we do not take any responsibility for items lost due to incidents that occur during the fight.
Also, you should remember that monsters in the arena are not necessarily the same as the monsters you're familiar with outside of the arena -- they have been magically recreated.
