<p>Although I don't know the details, the scroll of demons is a scroll that was created by demons to strengthen the power of their magic.
<p>If someone uses a scroll of demons, it will snatch away part of the soul of the user and create a small round entity called a soul sphere.
<br>
<p>It's been a long time since I used it last so, I don't remember it too well. But, as soon as you use it, your mind will become foggy and you will fall into a deep oblivion.
<p>The sensation is from getting part of your soul sucked out of your body.
