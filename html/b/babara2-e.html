<p>As you probably know, there are terrible giants in those mountains but the injuries of those people were even more awful than what any giant could have done. According to one of them who had regained consciousness, the perpetrator attacked them near the entrance to the Tower of Insolence at the very edge of the Twilight Mountains.
<p>It was a giant... but no ordinary giant.  This was one of the mythical "ancient" giants who are supposedly even larger than the ones found nowadays.
<p>If I had not seen those injuries with my own eyes, I would not have believed what they said... But after looking at the ripped flesh and snapped limbs, I could not deny that there really were such creatures.
<p>
It is such an amazing story that I bet even you won't believe it. Since I didn't see the actual happenings myself, I can't guarantee that the situation was as they described. Still, if you find yourself going in the direction of the Twilight Mountains, please beware. Those adventurers were lucky and left with their lives but I don't think most would live to tell the tale.
