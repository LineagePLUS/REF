Wow! I was walking along the beach when I saw a <font fg=ffffff>sea dancer</font> for the first time in my life. Looking through the misty fog, it appeared to be in the form of a woman. I did realize that it was a monster, but seeing it like that, all I could do was let out a sigh. I've listened to other adventurers talk and it seems that magic is most effective at harming this perplexing monster. You really cannot tell it is a monster by appearance.
