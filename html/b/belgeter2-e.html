<p>The general principles of movement and attack apply to other activities too. After killing a monster, you may see that they have dropped items.  Or, you may see that someone has thrown something onto the ground. I am sure you will want to pick some items up.  If you <font fg=ffffff>click with your Mouse </font>on an item lying on the ground, you are its new owner. It's really that easy.
<br>
<p>And once you have acquired it, naturally you'll want to try it out. In that case, press the <font fg=ffffff>Tab key </font>or click the bag icon on the <font fg=ffffff>Menu in the bottom-right corner </font>of your screen to identify the item. Then <font fg=ffffff>double-click </font>on the item to use it. Nothing to it, huh?
<br>
<p>In the event you would like to throw an item away, do this: <font fg=ffffff>using your Mouse, drag</font> the item from the Item Window and leave it on the ground to discard it. When exchanging items with other people, make sure to do it in the Exchange Window so that it will be a secure trade. To intitiate a trade, face the person and type /trade in the chat window.
