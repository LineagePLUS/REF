<p>So what happened to the priestess Saelle, you ask?
</p>
<p>She too took on a horrible appearance from Fafurion's curse. Thankfully she avoided becoming a monster but she could never erase her feeling of hate against Fafurion, and the guilt of her foolish act. Somewhere in this barren land, she is probably waiting for the day she can take her revenge against Fafurion.</p>
