Are you interested in numbers?<br>
To live in this world that so reveres adena, you must understand mathematics. But alas, as the amounts grow larger and the equations more complex, mistakes are inevitably made. Many years ago I began researching a solution to this problem, and at last I've found it! I have invented a machine that does calculations automatically!<br><br>

Due to an unfortunate incident several years ago, I don't have enough money and ingredients to commercialize this device. Whatever shall I do?</p>
