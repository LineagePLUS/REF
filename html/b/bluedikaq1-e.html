<p>Hello there! Ronde told me about you, apparently you're a capable assassin.</p> 
<p>As you may know, because of certain assassins who conspired with the Pretender King, we Dark Elves are facing yet another trial.</p> 
<p>To those of us who have already lived our lives in darkness due to the bad decisions of our ancestors, it is unfortunate we are facing yet another ordeal like this.</p> 
<p>I need you to dispose of the assassins that are influencing our race with corrupt ideas.</p>
