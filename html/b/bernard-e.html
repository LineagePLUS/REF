Welcome to the training grounds! <br>
You'll find the scarecrows nearby offer a place to train your skills until you reach level five. Just stand near a scarecrow and hit him with your sword. Many a brave warrior has learned to use his sword just like that.<br><br>
If you're not one to stand in place swinging a blade, you might want to kill a few rabbits or frogs until you get a bit stronger. Be careful though - scarecrows don't fight back, but the monsters outside town will - and you're not much of a fighter just yet!<br><Br>
I have a few other tips about armor and weapons that you may find useful if you're interested.</p>
