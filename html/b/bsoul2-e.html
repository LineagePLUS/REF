<p>You… Why have you come here? What do you hope to obtain?
<p>Perhaps… like myself... you were led to this place by the tugging hand of desire.
<br>
<p>Ah… you're wondering what I am doing... in this place…
<p>I shall tell you because... I'd like to prevent you from committing the same folly that I did.
<br>
<p>In all my time to reflect in this place, I have found one truth.
<p>All the principles in this world are based upon the relation of cause and effect.
<p>If there is a cause, there is always a consequence. A good cause does not necessarily end in a good result but it will never result in a shameful consequence.
<p>A wrongful cause, however, will always result in a bad and irrevocable consequence.
<p>Everyone wants to change a bad consequence after it happens… Or else they try to cover it up so that nobody finds out about it.
<p>Inevitably, in trying to change a bad consequence, one will end up generating even worse consequences... And this vicious cycle just goes on and on.
<br>
<p>I... was attempting to change such a consequence and ended up becoming enslaved to an evil from which I can no longer detach myself.
<p>Whether or not you use the <a link="bsoul3">Scroll of Demons</a> is entirely up to you.
<p>I just hope that you will not repeat my stupidity.
<p>Please remember… that once you make a choice, it will be very difficult to undo it.
