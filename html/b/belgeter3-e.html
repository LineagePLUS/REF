<p>If you are finished learning the basic movements, it is time for you to learn how to talk to other people. Your friends may know many things that I could never teach you. 
<br>
<p>You don't need to be nervous because this is the easiest part of all. You only have to say what you want, by typing it in the Chat Window and hitting Enter. Then the people around you will immediately understand what you want to say. This is enough for now.
<br>
<p>But once you befriend someone, you will wish to discuss secret matters too.  In that case, enter your secret like this: <font fg=ffffff>"[Listener's name] [What you wish to say] </font>and no one will be able to eavesdrop on you. Ha, ha, ha.
