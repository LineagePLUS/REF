<p>If you go southwest from the town, you will find an entrance to the cave along the beach. A long time ago, when Karel Tanford built Windawood on the ruins of the dungeon he conquered, the remaining monsters fled to that cave. If you feel you have had enough training near the town, their lair may be a good place to advance to a higher level.
