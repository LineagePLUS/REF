<p>No one knows why Lindvior was so angry, although it is rumored that the Witch Kerenis did something horrible to him.
<p>Lindvior is said to be weaker than the fire dragon Valakas, the most powerful of all dragons, but still extremely dangerous. 
<p>In that attack, one third of Aden's population was wiped out. That attack still haunts some of the older folk around here.
<p>Since that battle, nobody has seen any trace of Lindvior again but... I suspect he'll make another appearance.
