<P>Hello, young friend.</P>
<br>
<P>This is the training ground. These scarecrows, or training dummies, have been erected so that you may practice in safety.</P>
<p>You may notice that as you attack them, your experience increases. As your level increases, so do your abilities.</P>
<p>You will only be able to advance to level 5 by using the training dummies. After this you'll need to hunt monsters to gain experience.</P>
<p>I've heard that Garret knows much about the monsters of this land. You should ask him for information as well.</P>
