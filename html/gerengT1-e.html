<p>I was banished from the Ivory Tower long ago. But I did not despair and have continued to walk the path of a Wizard. Only Einhasad knows whether the road I have taken is the true path or an evil path. Talass of the Ivory Tower... No matter what he says, I think I have walked the true path of a Wizard. 
<p>You must have come here wanting to learn something from me as a Wizard. Hmm... If you help me with my research, I will give you something in return that you'll definitely need as a Wizard.
