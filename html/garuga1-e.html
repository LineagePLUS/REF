<p>Uh, as you may well know, the Kingdom of Aden is far south from here. Have you ever been there?
When I first visited a long time ago, I was completely overwhelmed by the experience. It is so huge that dozens of our small towns could fit into the castle itself. The scene was so grand, I was speechless...<br>
Ah, and do you know that the Kingdom of Aden has turned to chaos because of the recent invasion of Lastabad?<br>
Because of that, an Aden protection group was formed recently in Aden and it is said that they are carrying out large-scale counter-attacks.<br>
It just seems that wars are breaking out all over. I just wish they'd stop.
