<p>There are many notable places in this remote region of Oren.
<p>Glacial Lake, Crystal Cavern, border camp, etc... But the number one symbol of Oren is surely none other than the <a link="dima2">Ivory Tower</a>, don't you think? Except for the Tower of Oman -- also known as the curse of Aden -- the Ivory Tower is the tallest building in Aden.
<p>Sometimes, just looking at the beautiful tower shooting up into the sky overwhelms me with emotion.
<p>But personally, I find the reflection of the tower on the surface of the Glacial Lake more beautiful than the view of the tower itself reaching high into the sky.
