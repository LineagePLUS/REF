<p>You know about the Mutant Ants don't you? I'm really worried because they threatened our very existence. They actually eat and carry away those of the same race!!!  Indeed, even the Giant Soldier Ants are said to avoid the Mutant Ants. People living near the desert think that we are the ones doing this treachery. In the past, they would give us grain if we went to town but now they just stab at us with iron spears when we go there... Anyway, those Mutant Ants have got to go if we and the humans are to live with peace of mind.  
<p>I wish the Battle Ants that have gone off on their military campaign would hurry and return... You know about the Battle Ants, don't you? Don't you remember when the Giant Soldier Ants were massacred by the Battle Ants because they were thought lazy?  Well, it was terrible!
<p>If you go to the west side, there is a Gatekeeper Ant guarding the entrance to the place where the Mutant Ants live. Go see him to hear more about the Mutant Ants. Perhaps it's because he is new at his job, but he has a hard time telling the difference between Battle Ants and ordinary ants. Not long ago, the fool said to me, "Please do me a favor, Mr. Battle Ant..."  Imagine mistaking me for a Battle Ant??! The nerve!
