<p>Everyone calls me Ellyonne. As you can see, I am an Elf.
<p>Perhaps I too have been influenced by the humans running about recklessly with their heads set only on what lies straight ahead, or maybe it has just been too long since I left the Elven Forest...
<p>I wonder if Narhen and Theodor are well... I am sure that mean old Nerupa is just the same. I miss the guardians who always welcomed me as I walked through the forest, the intoxicating scent of the Mother Tree... I think I have forgotten what the fruit given by ent tastes like...
<p>Still, my life has been meaningful since I finally succeeded in bringing back spirit magic.
<p>Such magic is a little too much for humans to learn, what with the different system and all. But it was nice of Elder Talass to congratulate me so sincerely.
<p>The people who helped me here did not receive any benefit for the long hours and endless support they gave me during my experiments. In spite of that fact, they still congratulated me. I was of course happy, but very sorry at the same time. 
<p>If you are looking for a spirit crystal in order to learn, try the shop downstairs.
<p>If not, do you have any questions about spirit magic? One thing I must remind you... spirit magic is only for Elves.
