<p>Lyra:</p>


<p>Most orcs in the Aden kingdom don't live as a group, but the orcs in this
forest have assembled to form tribes. Each tribe serves its own totem and
sometimes the orcs here carry their tribe's totem, made from the bones of
animals. </p>

<p>The orcs who are transferring the adena are definitely Gandi Orcs, the
lowest in the hierarchy...bring me their totems. </p>
