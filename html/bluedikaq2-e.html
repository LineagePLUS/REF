<p>Our assassin's guild uses only weapons that have been handed down to us in the legends from long ago. Granted, they look like simple scraps of metal to folks of little ability, but...</p> 
<p>The ability to use the true power of these weapons is something that can be achieved only by members of our assassin's guild, which is made up of the strongest Dark Elf warriors.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if you were able to revive those legendary weapons, it would be a significant contribution to your fighting abilities.</p>
<p>Go find the dwarf blacksmith Koup in the village. He is very familiar with what I've been telling you and enjoys making the weapons.</p>
