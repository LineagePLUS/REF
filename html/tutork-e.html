The Knight is the easiest character for the new player to use. A good Knight should have plenty of strength, as they specialize in battling an opponent with their sword.   They begin in Hidden Valley.
<BR>
Knights are the most fierce warriors in Lineage, with more strength than the other classes.  In addition to this, they have the ability to use more armor and weapons than any other class, making them quite effective in both giving and absorbing damage.
<BR><br>
The primary statistics for a Knight should be strength and constitution, which control not only the amount of damage they can do, but their ability to receive damage and heal.
Secondarily, dexterity is useful; it affects one's ability to hit with accuracy.
<BR>
The down side of being a Knight is that they have no innate ability to cast magical spells at all. They are dependent on potions and scrolls or friendly party members for magical support.  
<BR>
Knights thus have a vested interest in seeking the patronage of a powerful Prince or Princess.
