<p>You must be the brave Blood Pledge Prince about whom I've heard many good things. Could you use your powerful influence to help the unfortunate citizens of this town? Please... 
<p>For a long time now, our townspeople have been enduring much harm from the ants that live in the desert.  Nobody likes to admit it but we live in fear. In the past, the ants only took items in the grain storehouse that is in the town, but now they are grabbing and taking away even the people!  I beg you to help us.
