<p>We Elves lose our power once we touch normal metal...so we can't approach iron or copper - they are metals.
<br>
Mithril, however, is different - it's blessed by Einhasad Herself, so the essence of fairy is still there. Further it's very light, and strong - quite suitable for making weapons.
<br>
How do you make mithril? The way to <font fg=ffffff>refine rough mithril into pure mithril </font>is known only to the fairy folk.
If you can bring rough mithril to them, they will make it pure.</p>
