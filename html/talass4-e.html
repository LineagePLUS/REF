<p>Dark Elves... They are known to have a disposition for darkness, opposite that of Elves. To those of us who follow Einhasad, they are unpleasant beings because they worship Gran Kain and have received the blessings of darkness.
<p>I'll tell you a story from long ago -- from the golden age, when the gods roamed these lands.
<p>The holy Elven race, blessed by their creator, Einhasad, was born with a countenance and nature superior to any other creature. They loved nature and talked with the spirits so that they were said to be the most supreme creation the gods had ever made.<br> As time passed, all creatures of Einhasad spread out to the ends of the earth and formed their own societies. And an arrogance, born from being the greatest of all creations, gained a foothold within the Elves. <br>It is that arrogance which started to kindle the fire of distrust, and eventually loathing, amongst the Elves.
<p>And so came a war between Elves and Humans, but the Elves were no longer united and so were defeated by the destruction and cruelty of the Humans and were chased to the Dark Forest. After the war was over, those that reflected on their own arrogance wanted to live in harmony with nature and have pure minds like those before them. But the other Elves that opposed them insisted that they should also have their own freedom like the Humans -- freedom that doesn't distinguish between good or evil and strives only for development.<br> Some of the Elves that lost the war resented their own weakness and turned away from Einhasad, their own creator and chose to serve Gran Kain, the god of darkness. Their skin took on a taint in likeness to their god, Gran Kain. They also received a curse from Einhasad and came to have a lifespan similar to that of Humans, dispossessed of their nearly eternal life. 
<p>Even more disturbing, however, is the black magic they use. According to the ancient magic books, they burned black their own strength of life in order to use it as an ingredient in their black magic. And so their power is as incredible as their will is strong. Not only that, there are also rumors that they have colluded with evil spirits. It seems that they want to drag this world into a hellish war no matter what price they end up paying.
<p>I'm not sure if you found my story interesting.<br> Since I'm old and don't have a lot to do, I'm always very glad to meet adventurers such as yourself that come to visit.<br> <img src="#331" link="talass"></img>
