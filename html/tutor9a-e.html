NON-PLAYER CHARACTER (NPC) INTERACTION 
<BR><BR>
You can talk to other player characters (PCs) and non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs are in-game characters such as merchants, teleporters, and enchanters, who can offer you information about the game, buy things from you, sell things to you, and cast spells on you. You can tell an NPC by running your Cursor over the character. If your Cursor turns into a mouth icon, this is an NPC and it probably has something to say! 
<BR><BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Residents:</font>  Those who live in the town you are adventuring near. They can give you general information about the area, or just an idea as to what their life is like. 
<BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Merchants:</font>  Those who can buy, sell, make, or repair things for you. 
<BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Storage Merchants:</font>  Those who - for a fee - will keep your belongings safe until you need them. This way, you are not forced to carry your entire inventory with you at all times. 
<BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Teleporters:</font>  Those who can send you to another town for a price. This helps you avoid walking from town to town. There are free teleporters in Hidden Valley and on Singing Island that teleport you to Silver Knight Town and Talking Island if you are under level 10. 
<BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Enchanters:</font>  Those who cast magical spells on you to help you in combat. These spells only last a certain amount of time, but can be very useful, especially haste and bless armor spells. 
<BR>
<font fg=ffffff>Healers:</font>  A type of enchanter that can restore your HP when you come back to town from battle. You can usually find them near the gates in new player zones. (In the Elven Forest, the Mother Tree and World Trees act as healers.)
