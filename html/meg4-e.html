<P>
Are you a traveler? Did you see the lump of ash that nearby Gludin Village was turned into by the recent invasion of the Dark Elves?<br> 
Martial law has already been declared for this place also so you should not go around carelessly in the village or outside the castle. You never know what could happen...</P>
<P>Ah, and you should be careful of the huge holes in the desert. Those are where the giant ants live and many adventurers have been blinded with greed at the treasures the ants collect and have ended up losing their lives in search of them.
