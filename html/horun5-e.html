<p>Ah, the first life form in this forest created by Einhasad.</p>
<p>According to our sacred books, Einhasad created the World Tree on the void earth, and the life force from this World Tree filled the earth and created the other animals and plants.</p>
<p>In this forest where the life force of the World tree is concentrated, Einhasad created Elves from a leaf of the World Tree. Elves were promised a peaceful life as the beings most loved by the first life form.</p>
<br>
<p>Even now, when Einhasad and Gran Kain are fighting, the World Tree benefits every Elf...Elves can still feel warmth around the World Tree.</p>
