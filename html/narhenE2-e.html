<p>Pans are famous for their ferocity, because they try to trample everything that stands in their way. Nothing except music can restrain them, because of its purity.
<br>
But we Elves can make useful things by taking advantage of that. If you bring ecdysis along with mithril or oriharukon, they will make a <a link="narhenE4">mithril plate</a> or an <a link="narhenE5">oriharukon plate</a> by trampling the materials with their hard hooves.
<br>The ones most afraid of their ferocity are the humans who want to invade the forest; pans are the most trustworthy guardians of the forest.
