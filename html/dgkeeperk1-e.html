<p>The messenger has just been here. From him, I heard you have come to train in the Passage of Hardship. Good luck!</p>
<br>
<p>Once you pass the entrance, there will be four roads. Each road leads to the a complex maze, but one leads you to the key. All you have to do is enter the werewolf's room near the entrance with the key, and slay the werewolf.
<br>
<p>If you get exhausted you can leave, but you should get permission from Lord Gerard before attempting the maze again, because many young Knights are waiting to test their mettle.</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<br>

<a action="entertestdg">Enter the Passage of Hardship.</a>
