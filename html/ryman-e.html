Hello. My name is Ryman. Because of the invasion of the Dark Elven army, the inn has been badly damaged. They set it on fire and it was in a sad state but my sister, Lolia, and I are working hard to restore it. 
<br>
I think we still have a room left that is somewhat usable, if you need one, but it won't be much. I hope you'll understand.
