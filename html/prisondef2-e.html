Ha! So now you're curious, huh?<br>
OK, fine. I'll tell you.<br>
It is our belief that each individual should be allowed to decide what is right and what is wrong. No one is under any obligation to accept other's opinions in these matters. <br>
The ultimate judges of such things can only be the gods, but yet, the underground forces of our race have developed a warped sense of justice... and so will live to regret their indiscretion. The gods shall never forgive the chaos they have caused in the world with their reckless behavior.<br>
I do not regret the many years I have spent fighting this scourge. They are evil heretics and are bound to get their comeuppance in the end.
