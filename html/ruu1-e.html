<p>The current tribal community is possible due solely to the efforts of the chief of the Seghem Tribe...now that he is getting weaker, the other tribes are in turmoil. Maybe if he dies, they will scatter like before.
<p>Large tribes like the Atuba or Neruga will be all right, but the smaller tribes like Rova or Gandi, who are accustomed to the communal system, would end up crushed or absorbed...
