<br>
<p>You are a being loved by the good God, but because of this, you are also vulnerable to Gran Kain's sweet seduction.</p>
<p>Unlike you, humans are born from the eternal conflict between Einhasad and Gran Kain. Due to that fact, even though they always waver between good and evil, they don't usually turn to one side completely. They are far less perfect than us, but because of that, they are much more loving.</p>
<br>
<p>So you may develop friendship with a human someday...and no one knows where that person will lead you.</p>
<p>You should remember one thing for sure. If that person deserves your love, you should love them forever. And if you want to bring that person here, you may use <font fg=ffffff>fairy dust</font> to avert the eyes of the guardians.</p>
<p>Guardians are not flexible; they won't tolerate a human even if he is with you...but when they are distracted by the fairy dust that they love the most, you two will be able to pass through the forest relatively safely.</p>
