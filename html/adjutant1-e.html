<p>Long time no see Chief Kurtz!
<p>Through a liaison, I heard the news that you are currently raising a new military force.
<p>While you were away, here in Gludio, several events of greater and lesser significance have happened.
<p>One of them was the invasion of Gludio by the Lastabad army from the underground.
<br>
<p>As though it was giving us a taste of a large scale war that is to come, the Lastabad army completely destroyed and burnt everything down in Gludin, leaving it in ruins.
<p>I think the reason they so ruthlessly burnt everything in Gludin, a town that has been under the protection of the majestic Kent Castle, is to make the entire region of Aden feel the pressure of their superior power and thereby create large-scale panic and chaos.
<p>In spite of their intention, however, Aden experienced only temporary confusion and is now in the process of recovering its previous state of order. After this incident, I've heard that the king of Aden enlisted the help of other castle lords and established a large mercenary troop called the guardians of Aden.
<br>
<p>And I've heard that the forces of Lastabad are being defeated thanks to the recent overcoming of that chaos.
<br>
<p>So it appears that this latest incident provided an opportunity for the entire Aden region to rally their forces together. Even the Dwarves of the Dwarven Castle are joining the guardians of Aden and this makes me think that our future is not so dark.
<br>
<p>Oh! I have one more thing to report. We have completed our analysis of documents about the manufacturing technique of weapons which was received from the army of Lastabad. By applying their technique to our existing technology, we have come up with a new way of manufacturing weapons.
<p>Therefore, Kurtz, if you would like to apply the new weapon manufacturing technique to the swords that are currently in your inventory, please let me know.
<br>
<p><a action="request enchanted sword of chief">Apply the new weapon manufacturing technique to Kurtz's Sword.</a></p>
