Do you see the huge tower on the far side which has collapsed? That is the famous <font fg=ffffff>Water Dragon Lighthouse</font>. Nobody knows how long that tower has stood. Even though it can't be used as before because of its condition, seen from far across the sea long ago, it resembled the water dragon Fafurion, hence the name. Isn't it interesting that the most necessary lighthouse for fishermen is named after the dangerous water dragon Fafurion? And the rumor says that there is an entrance to the subterranean waterway of Heine in that lighthouse -- in addition to the entrance at Eva's Temple. Do you suppose the rumor is true?
