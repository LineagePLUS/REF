<p>Common sense dictates that after a harsh cold winter, warm spring comes to melt away the snow and bring green back to the trees... But the area surrounding the <a link="ruru2">Glacial Lake</a>  is always full of cold snow with hard frozen ice. Of course, this entire region of Oren is the coldest place in all of Aden.<br>
Oh, hey. Recently I was in Giran and heard a creepy story. It seems that the Dark Elven army has invaded the southern areas and many people died when the invaders burned the villages. And because of that, a huge war has ensued...  We don't get a lot of news from outside our village so I don't know exactly but I'm worried that something else terrible will happen.
