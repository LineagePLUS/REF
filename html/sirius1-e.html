<p>Come on in! I am the Wizard Sirius who has been dispatched here from the Ivory Tower of Oren.
<p>
The Ivory Tower provides a variety of services to promote the use of magic for the public good.
<p>But there is one thing you should take note of. Here in Aden, there are limits on teleporting in order to make Aden Castle more secure.
<p>I can send people from Aden who want to go elsewhere but they are not able to use teleporting to return.
<p>OK, so where would you like to go?
