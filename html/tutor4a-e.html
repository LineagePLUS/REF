When you die, the system window will appear on the right side of your screen, giving you the following options: Restart, Quit and Cancel. 
<br><br>
Restart 
<br><br>
If you wish to play more, select the Restart button. 
Select the character you want to play at the character selection screen. If you select the same character you were just playing and are under level 10, you will be resurrected in the town you were closest to when you died. If your character belongs to a pledge, he or she will resurrect in the pledge's safe house or castle.
<br>
Eat some food, so that HP and MP will regenerate more quickly. We recommend keeping your food gauge above 70%. 
<br>
Restore your hit points (HP). Human classes should go to a healer (new player zones only), or use spells, potions, or inns to regenerate HP and MP. In addition to inns, potions and spells, Elves may also go to the Mother of the Forest and Elves (Mother Tree) for regeneration. 
Now you are ready to continue playing! 
<br><br>
Quit
<br><br>
If you choose Quit when your character is killed, you will exit the game. The next time you log into the game, the character will start at the nearest town or its pledge house. As with Restart, your character will have very low hit point, mana and food levels which should be replenished a fair amount before venturing out. 
<br><br>
Cancel
<br><br>
Lineage offers you the opportunity to be resurrected by another player if you choose Cancel once killed. When you die, you may still communicate with people in your area, so you could ask another player to resurrect you. If a player chooses to resurrect you, your character is revived in the exact spot it was killed. It is usually wise to wait until the chaos of the battle subsides a bit before resurrecting because your character will only have some hit points upon being resurrected and can be immediately attacked by aggressive monsters. 
<br>
After a few idle minutes, if your character has not been resurrected the restart function will be initiated. A resurrection scroll can be purchased for 1000-1500 adena and used by any class of character. You cannot resurrect yourself - another player must resurrect you.

Consequences of Dying
<br><br>
Although dying can teach you which monsters you can and cannot conquer, dying has some consequences: you may drop one or more of your items and you will lose experience points (after level 10). 
<br><br>
Loss of Experience: The amount of experience points lost is usually around 13%. If you have less than 13% experience at a level, it is quite possible that you will "level down" if you die. For instance, if you are level 12 with 10% experience at that level, your death will probably result in your character restarting at level 11 with about 97% experience. Your hit points (HP) and mana points (MP) are reduced when you level down as well. 
<br><br>
You will find as you level down and back up again, the amount of HP/MP regained is not consistent. The change in HP and MP values are determined by a random "roll of the dice" each time you level down and then again when you level back up. The HP change is directly related to constitution and a dice roll; the MP change is derived from wisdom and a dice roll. This could work for or against you, so if you're happy with your HP and MP increase when you level up, be extra careful not to die until you've cleared over 13% experience in that level. 
<br><br>
Loss of Items: Another consequence of dying is the risk of dropping items, once over level 5. The likelihood of dropping items is increased when your character is of chaotic alignment. You have no control of the items that are dropped. The only defense against this is for your character to become fully lawful. When your character attains this alignment, you will no longer drop items when you die. 
<br><br>

There are some items you will never drop--the items you came into the world with. 
<br><br>
Dying is common and it happens frequently. To avoid it, use all the defenses at your disposal. A few items that you may find helpful during combat are potions, scrolls and spells. The various potions available can raise your hit points when they're low, cure poison and even temporarily enhance your physical abilities. Scrolls can, among other things, teleport you quickly away from danger. Spells can do what many of the potions and scrolls can but you need mana to cast them, so it's always a good idea to carry potions and scrolls, even if you're a Wizard.
