<P>The underground dungeon is a very dangerous place.</p>
<p>If you'll go and explore it for me, I will give you one of my precious possessions as a token of appreciation. But you must bring back a black key from the underground dungeon as proof of your trip. You will be able to find the black key by reading the mysterious writings on the walls down there.</p>
<P>You'll need the help of Wizard Kun to enter the underground dungeon. Wizard Kun is always at the gates, so you will be able to find him easily.</p>
