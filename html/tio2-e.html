<P>I knew I got the right person.</p>
<p>If you'll examine the underground dungeon for me, I will give you a treasure of the town in return for your service. But you must bring back a red key from the underground dungeon as evidence of your excursion. You can find the location of the red key by reading the passages on the underground dungeon wall.</p>
<P>One more thing... in order to get into the underground dungeon, you need Wizard Coco's help. Wizard Coco is always at the gates, so you will have no trouble finding him.</p>
