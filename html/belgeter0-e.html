<p>Welcome! There is nothing to worry about, so look for me. Do you see me? If you cannot, use the <font fg=ffffff>Mouse </font>to get around. Click on the surrounding land and you can move where you click. Come and try talking to me. The method is very simple -- <font fg=ffffff>move the cursor to where I am and watch it change into the shape of a mouth. Then click!</font>
<br>
<p>There's nothing to it, so hurry over and I will give you words of advice that will become your flesh and blood.
