<p>You didn't forget that every being in this forest is fundamentally <font fg=ffffff>self-sufficient</font>, did you?  The rule around here is that you should get and make everything you need on your own.</p>
<p>Well, I say that, but... <font fg=ffffff>Nerupa</font> can help you make almost everything you need if you bring the materials to her. And you can get the <font fg=ffffff>materials from guardians or at various places in the forest</font>.  Ask some of the Elves in the town and they will give you a lot of good advice.</p>
