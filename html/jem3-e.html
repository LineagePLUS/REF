<P>If only I knew the magical secret behind giving souls to the undead, such as zombies and ghouls, I feel I could breathe magical power into anything.</p>
<P>My study of this mysterious magic is almost complete, but I'm lacking certain necessary and rare ingredients, so I can’t confirm my theory just yet.</p>
<P>If you will find me the nail and tooth of a ghoul, I will reward you with a fascinating product of my magic in return.</p>
<P>The ghoul dwells in a dungeon located to the northwest of this town.  Remember that a ghoul's poison has the property of paralyzing your entire body. And because the ghoul is an undead monster, you can attack it easily by employing turn undead or healing magic.</p>
