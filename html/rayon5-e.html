Our love is deeper than the deepest river, but we can never be together...<br>
You see, I'm a Human and she's an Elf!<br>

When our passion was discovered she was taken away and imprisoned within the Elven Forest. Now I shall never see her again! My heart shall be consumed by the undying flames of my love for her! <br>
If only... I could give her this ring...
