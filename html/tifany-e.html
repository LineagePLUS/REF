<p>This is a special training room that 
Masters Talass and Ellyonne took care to prepare for the benefit of Elves who wish to learn the art of spirit magic.
<p>Unlike Wizards who keep their spells in magic books, the key to the Elves' spirit magic is in jewels called spirit crystals. Such jewels contain distinctive natural powers.
<p>In theory, magic should be learned by Elves when using the crystals next to the Mother Tree in the Elven Forest, where Elves can best become one with nature. But this training room was prepared by the two masters to reproduce the essence of the Mother Tree.
<p>This must be very helpful for Elves who are interested in spirit magic, don't you think?
