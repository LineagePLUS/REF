<P>By bringing back the Emblem Piece, you have demonstrated your qualification as a Prince and, at the same time, your strong determination to resist the Pretender King.  </p>
<P>Now, take the ring I gave you and show it to Duke Digardeng who is in Ivory Tower Town - and then be filled with strength from him.  </p> 
<P>May the blessings of Einhasad be with you...</p>
