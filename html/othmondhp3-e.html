<br>
<p>Taxation is your royal right; similarly it's your responsibility to pay a tribute to Ken Rauhel, the lord of this kingdom.
<p>You have the power to adjust the tax of this province; the adjusted tax will be applied to the shops in the village around the castle and the shops in the Gludin Village, thus affecting all trades there.
<p>Once you decide the rate of taxation, it is effective the next day. If you change the tax rate several times in a day, the next day's tax rate will be the last one you set.
<p>Gathered taxes will be transferred to the castle around dawn the next day.
<p>All the taxes belong to you, my lord. But, you must spend wisely, because it costs money to manage the castle and lands, and to pay tribute to the king.
<p>The higher you set the taxes, the more adena flow into the castle treasury. However, be wise, for if you raise the taxes too much, people will not support you. So please keep that in mind when adjusting the taxes.
