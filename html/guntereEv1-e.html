<p>The eternal trees and timeless earth are your teachers, not one such as myself.
<p>I do not presume that I can teach you, nor test you. Your kind can not possibly understand my teachings or my way of thinking. 
<p>You live above human law, yet you live among humans; your soul is free...but such freedom comes at a great price. I wish you the best.
