<p>Young leaf of the world tree... You have successfully completed the test that I gave you. Don't worry too much about Darkmar having run away.  At least he won't be able to come back for a little while. Now, go to Werlden Town where the humans live and find the man named Marshall, who is Digardeng's chamberlain. He may be human but he has had a close relationship with us Elves and is waiting for help from us. You'll fully understand later why I've told you to go find Marshall once you're there. Now leave the Elven Forest for the world where humans live.
