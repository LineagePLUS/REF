<p>According to that Knight, the suit of armor belongs to the death knight and its strength is said to be beyond words. The death knight tried to put the world's strongest creature, the violent dragon, to death but ended up being cursed by the dragon's blood and losing his soul. It will be nearly impossible to do so, but the one that acquires and wears all of the death knight's armor... helmet, mail, gloves, and boots... well, that person's potential will surely be amazing.
<p>And if the rumors are anything to go by, the person who gets all four parts of the death knight's armor will be granted abilities equal to that of the death knight...
