<p>It's a wing like thing on the back of <a link="doettE9">fairy</a>.
Ala of fairy is used to travel between the material plane and elemental plane of fairies.
We Elves can use the <font fg=ffffff>Ala of fairy</font> to <font fg=ffffff>teleport</font> through the
Elven Forest. Also the membrane in Ala of fairy is very sharp and can be made quite tough
by coating it with mithril - which could prove to be quite useful. But to get it you have to give
<font fg=ffffff>5 pieces of mithril thread and 40 pieces of <a link = "doettE15">fairy dust</font> to the fairies. I've heard that the fairies use the thread and dust to clothe themselves - but that's just a rumor.</p>
