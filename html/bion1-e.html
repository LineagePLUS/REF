<p>Do you know what lies beneath the snow-covered land of Oren?
<p>The story, whether you choose to believe it or not, is that the Ice Queen keeps her home here and that's why the landscape is covered deep in gleaming white snow. Her abode is the famous <a link="bion2">Crystal Cavern.</a>
<p>They say if you travel east from the Ivory Tower, you can find the entrance to the Crystal Cavern.
<p>
Of course, that place is way too dangerous for ordinary people like us to enter. Although we don't compare to adventurers like yourselves, we still have the urge to venture inside. Rumor has it that the interior of the Crystal Cavern is so fantastic that you could lose your mind in there...!
<p>If you ever get a chance to visit the Crystal Cavern, please do tell me what it was like.
