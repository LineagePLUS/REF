<p>I'm still very upset about the alliance with Gora Agni -- he betrayed our communal system.
<p>Nevertheless, it's true that there are some humans who don't like the slime races... I can see no reason why you reject Gora's offer. Furthermore, we can raise our strength with that money, so I won't say anything about the current contract.
<p>To get the slime race profit, one of your members has to visit Gora. If he speaks to Gora, Gora will send his henchman to deliver the profit here.
<p>But... Be careful. Recently those pesky humans at the burnt field are acting strangely. Maybe they have already found out that our main financial source is the slime races.  They may try to intercept the carrier. You must have some of your powerful members accompany him.
