<P>I've heard about you from Aria.  </p>
<P>Your actions in Woodbec were highly commendable and Duke Digardeng is also eagerly looking forward to meeting you.  </p>
<P>However, as Duke Digardeng's servant, I would like to be doubly certain that you are truly a Prince.  </p>
<P>If you complete all the steps in my test, you will be given the opportunity to meet with Duke Digardeng.</p>
