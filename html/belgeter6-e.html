<p>Did you know that when conversing with others, you cannot hear what people beyond a certain distance are saying? Well, there is a way to be heard over a larger area. For example, you and a person far away can "shout" to each other in order to carry on a dialogue. Of course whispering might make more sense if you are talking to just one other person, but there are times when whispering is not practical.
<br>
<p>Typing <font fg=ffffff>![What you wish to say]</font> is the method for shouting. You should understand that this method consumes quite a bit of strength and unless your food gauge is full you won't have the energy to shout; instead, you'll give out pathetic whines. If you shout often, you will quickly become hungry.
<br>
<p>Still, a great number of people use this method. In fact, due to so many people shouting at the same time, you may have difficulty saying what is truly important when the need arises. If this happens to you, try typing <font fg=ffffff>/chat off</font>. Then you will not have to listen to all that is being shouted out. If you wish to return to the original chatting condition, all you have to do is type <font fg=ffffff>/chat on</font>. Understand?
