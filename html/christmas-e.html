<p>Let's celebrate the birth date of Einhasad!
<p>Though it's not specified in the Libram, I heard that these red socks were given to the first human by Einhasad, so that she would not hurt her feet on the rough ground.
<p>So to commemorate that event, we have a custom to exchange socks with neighbors. In this way, we hope that the blessing Einhasad gave to the first human may fall upon us as well!
<br>
<p>Who knows? If you perform good deeds until December 25, Einhasad Herself may give you a great reward!
