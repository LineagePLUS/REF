Although this village is relatively small and quiet, the ingredients that I need for my research will not come easily. <br>
Bring me the following items and I will give you a scroll of bravery:<br><br>

2 Hearts of Firebird<br>
2 Hearts of Ice Queen<br>
2 Hearts of Golem<br>
2 Hearts of Drake<br><br>

The four hearts represent crystals of the four elements. Ryumiel in Aden will make the crystals for you.<br>
In case you were wondering, Ryumiel is a pupil of mine whom I love deeply. You will find her quite skillful.<br><br>
