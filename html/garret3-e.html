Some special monsters have a strong inclination to band together. Because of that, you will sometimes encounter unexpected situations.
<p>For example, when attacking a kobold or an orc, if there are other monsters of the same species (in this case, kobolds and orcs), you could find yourself in a scene where they will recognize you as an enemy and gang up to attack.
<p>Also, when you want to hunt werewolves, they could be joined by beasts that are similar but not of the same species, such as dogs or wolves. If you want to become a skilled hunter, you must learn about the character of these beasts and alway be on the look out. It would be good to develop a habit of observing the other monsters around you.
<p>And, of the monsters that fly around, there are those that must drop something to the ground in order to fly down. You should be careful because they sometimes descend to the ground in order to attack humans.
