<p>What do you think about the ent? Ent was originally a tree, so it remains silent for most of the time. But in this world, there are many more things to be communicated than just those that can be said through words. Close your eyes and listen quietly. Harmonize with nature and then try to communicate with your mind. You will see a new side to the world.<br>
<br>Of course, obtaining the <a link="theodorE2">twig of ent</a> and <a link="theodorE3">bark of ent</a> are the only important things right now to the likes of you. Well, I guess different methods are required to live in this world. And that's why such an honorable person as <a link="theodorE4">Nerupa</a> is having difficulties in his life...</p>
