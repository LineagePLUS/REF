<p>The blade can chip when hitting something strong - like, if you bang on castle gates with your sword. There are monsters out there that will wear away your weapons and armor, too. For example, it would be outright stupid to attack a stone golem with a sword since the blade will not slice or pierce the thing -- you won't damage the monster at all. Fortunately, blunt objects like an axe or morning star do not have such limitations.
