<p>What have you come looking for, adventurer?
<p>Seeing that you've made your way here, I'd say that you're probably someone who has lost his soul to magic. If not, are you a person wanting to understand magic in order to achieve a more perfect way of the sword?
<p>I am Talass, the highest elder of the Ivory Tower.
<br>
<p>The Ivory Tower is not as amazing a place as those on the outside say it is but because this is known as the center of magic, there are many things that are interesting in their own right.
<p>Look around slowly.
