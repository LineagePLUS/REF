<p>Because of that, a lot was learned about those that have defiled the name of the Dark Elves.</p>
<p>I want to entrust you with a very important task on which the independence of the Dark Elves depends.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a body of desire called the "Dark Star" that has been passed down to us Dark Elves throughout the ages. It shows whether or not we Dark Elves are independent or not. If the body of desire has deteriorated, then it means there is a problem with our independence. If it has been destroyed, then so has the independence of the Dark Elves.</p>
<br>
<p>The biggest problem now is that we don't even know where that body of desire is. And so, I would like you to go find and bring the "Dark Star" to me.</p>
<br> <a action="quest 24 bluedikaq7">Perform the task.</a><br>
