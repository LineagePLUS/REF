<p>Nerupa is one of the elder <a link="theodorE5">arachnes</a>. She lives in the cave beside the Mother of the Forest and Elves. She has been making things for us Elves while living together with the World Tree, bound by the fate Einhasad endowed upon her. She's been there for a thousand years; she can't escape this fate... I don't follow Gran Kain, but I sometimes doubt about the will of Einhasad. Maybe those thoughts are too dangerous...</p>
