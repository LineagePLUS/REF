<p>'Tis the very first life form Einhasad ever created, and the very heart of the Elven Forest. As soon as the first life form took root on the barren ground, the energy of life surrounded the tree, causing growth which eventually formed the forest. Then Einhasad created us from the leaf of the World Tree. The first Elf was born of the World Tree.  After this birth of the Elven race, that first Elf merged with the World Tree. Since then, she has been called the Mother of the Forest and Elves.
<br>The World Tree is truly a mother to us and always exudes life force.  We can heal quickly if we go there when we are tired or injured.
<br>As the forest expands, the number of trees like this also increases.  Now there are three other world trees with these healing powers besides the Mother of the Forest and Elves at the town plaza. They provide useful resting places for tired Elves in the forest.
