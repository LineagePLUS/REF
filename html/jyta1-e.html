<p>I am Jyta, a student of history. It's a bit odd looking at a lone woman traveling around like this with such scroungy attire, isn't it?<br>
I'm from Elmore, to the North. When I heard that the Dark Elven army had invaded, I rushed myself down here. As a student of history, I just want to experience the place where such fresh history is being made.<br>
And I've been going here and there gathering information about the Dark Elven army that has aggressively caused this war. This does not seem to be a war started simply for the profit to be gained from taking territory.<br>
What I heard from a Dark Elven elder of the Assassins Guild living in Silent Cavern is that these Dark Elves are a religious group that is rather fanatical.
And the god that they serve is Gran Kain who is the god of darkness that opposes Einhasad who is the god worshipped in our land by Humans and Elves. It makes me think that this is almost a kind of religious war. What in the world could the people that caused this war have been thinking?
<br>
I've also heard that the place where the Dark Elven army attacked from is an underground area... I know that is a dangerous location too but I'd still like to go there sometime.
