<p>After fleeing from Aden Castle, I realized that I would need more allies to defeat the Pretender King - thus, I created this training ground for true Knights, under the protection of the lord of Windawood Castle. This area was once a prospering town, but because of all the monsters from <a link="gerardk6">the cave on the southern beach</a> and the western wilderness, this area was almost deserted. I realized that with time and effort, this place could become a good place for the Knights to train.
