<p>I am the 192nd successor chef of Elven wafer cuisine. Elven wafers are food for only those Elves who have amplified the power of the forest using magic. Any Elf who eats this will become active and energetic as if living in his/her own home magical field and will be able to move much more quickly. This food is highly recommended for those seeking to travel beyond the forest. <br><br>
If you give me <font fg=ffffff>5 fairy dusts and one fruit of ent</font>, I will cook it up for you right away. It will be helpful during your trip.</p>
