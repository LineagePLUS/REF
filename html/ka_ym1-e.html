<p>Excuse me, are you going to Aden Cathedral? I'm a tourist, and have seen many amazing things in my travels...
<p>I've heard of the remarkable grandeur of Aden Cathedral. I've also heard that merely looking at the goddesses there can grant redemption for past sins...
<p>Oh, well, I'm going on... Could you take me to Aden Cathedral?
