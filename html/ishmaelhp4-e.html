<p>I can take care of all the minute affairs of the castle, so you don't have to pay attention to such things. But you will have to give orders regarding the management of the castle gate during times of war.
<p>There are two gates in this castle, the inner gate and the outer gate. The inner gate is the one between the castle you are standing in right now and the outside. The outer gate is the one located in the outer castle wall which surrounds this castle.
<p>As a convenience, you or all of your followers can open/close the inner gate through the gatekeeper beside the gate. But the outer gate, which is directly related to the security of the whole castle, is accessible to your highness only -- please issue orders to me if you want to open or close the outer gate.
<p>If you open the outer gate, it will allow enemies to come into the inner castle, which is very dangerous. But if you keep the gate closed too long, people will be unable to use the facilities in the castle such as the forge. Since they are the main sources of funding for the castle treasury, it could cause financial problems. So, you must carefully consider these facts when you want to close the gates.
<p>Furthermore, both gates can be destroyed by the assault from infiltrators during war. Once the gates are destroyed, they can be fixed only after the war ends. And if war occurs during the repairs, we stop the repairs. Of course it costs money to repair the gate; when the gate is destroyed completely, it could cost thousands of adena. You have to decide when we will fix the gates based upon these facts.
