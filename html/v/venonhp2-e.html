<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Chamberlain Venon:</p></font>
<br>
<p><var src="#0">Your highness, you are the lord of this castle. And I have managed the castle and its dominions as chamberlain since the days this castle was called the Gludio Castle. I pride myself on knowing more about this castle and its territory than anyone else. 
<p>That is why many have become the lord of this castle and retired as such during my time as chamberlain, but I watch over the castle and its territory and assist the lord -- whoever they may be. 
<p>My loyalty lies not with an individual but with the "Lord of the Heine Territory." Therefore, I swear my allegiance to you for as long as you are lord of this manor. 
<p>You will collect taxes through me and hire mercenaries with that money to become the most powerful being in this region, but you must not abuse this power. I beg that you rule your dominion wisely, keeping the citizens of this region in mind. 
<p>Lastly -- and I am only saying this out of kindness -- as the lord, your highness will always exist in this world. Even when you leave this world, your spirit will stay her and, except for unavoidable circumstances, it will accept all wars that challenge you. Therefore, please refrain from wandering around outside the castle unprotected. And when leaving this world, do so in a safe place; you never know when or where someone is trying to slay your highness.
