<p>You want to know more about me? Since Aden is in such confusion now, it shouldn't be a problem for me to tell you.</p>
<br>I belong to the Treasure Hunter Guild. We dig up the ruins left over from the wars with the Pretender King long ago and collect the weapons and armor that we find in those places. Then we sell those items without telling people where they came from.<p>
<br>Don't worry about there being a lack of items... Our Treasure Hunter Guild has an extensive history and many connections. <br><br>Of course, our guild isn't exactly a legal organization, but as the current situation is so chaotic, we are using this time to dispose of our inventory. <br><br>Really, I shouldn't be telling you this... <br>
<p>Please don't tell this to anyone else.</p>
