<p>
<p>All life gets returned to a handful of dust. Such is life…
<p>After you gain this understanding, it will be too late. There is no use for regrets.
<br>
<p>Driven by desire, a momentary lapse of reason… A life that cannot return to dust.
<br>
<p>It is too late to absolve my sins. Everything in this world means nothing to me now.
<p>I don't know the difference between what is good and what is bad any more.
<br>
<p>Only the path to the world beyond will complete the long journey of my harsh and difficult life.
