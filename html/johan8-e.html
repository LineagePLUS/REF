<p>The weapon of an adventurer is very important because it protects his/her life. Of course, for a Wizard, magic may be more useful than a weapon but no matter how great the Wizard is, he/she cannot deal with all enemies using magic alone. So, you can safely say that weapons are the most important tool for everyone. 
<br>
<p>In order to be equipped with a weapon, <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> the desired item in the item window. It's really very simple. This only works though if you are not already holding another weapon. One thing, there are one-handed weapons and two-handed weapons. Be aware that <font fg=ffffff>you cannot use a sheild when holding a two-handed weapon</font>.
