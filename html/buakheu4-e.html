Thanks to the magical boundary of water, Fafurion had no way of approaching Eva's Kingdom. Then Fafurion devised a plan.</p>
Fafurion transformed itself into the form of a handsome young man. Hiding its evil appearance, the monster made its way into Eva's Kingdom and approached Saelle, the priestess in charge of protecting the magical boundary of water. </p>
<p>Finally the priestess Saelle fell prey to Fafurion's false image, giving him access to the source of energy that created the boundary of water protecting Eva's Kingdom (Eva's Trident).  It was sealed in the temple. This was the most foolish act imaginable for Saelle, and the beginning of our <a link="buakheu5">misfortune</a>.</p>
