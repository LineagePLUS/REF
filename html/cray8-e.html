<p>You have enough potential as a hero - you just don't realize it. What you need right now is the confidence to manifest your true strength.</p>
<br>
<p>As recognition of your hard work, I'll give you this <font fg=ffffff>two-handed sword</font>. I pray that it will bring you a hero's glory when you face your next trial.</p>
