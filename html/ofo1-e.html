Though I'm not much of a fighter now, I was once a soldier under the lord. I fought hard then, for I thought I was defending my family by my own hand.<br>
But once I got back, it wasn't like that at all... I found my wife had died and our fields - ours from the time of my grandfather - were ruined from the war.

It seems that just as Ken Rauhel ran away, now the Dark Elven army... I mean, really! I just can't live in this world of unending war.<br>
