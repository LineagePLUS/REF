<p>Your sword'll lose its teeth if ya hit stone or a castle door with it. Also, haven't ya heard of monsters who can erode your armor or weapons? It's just plain ol' stupid to hit a stone golem with a sword or spear -- it does more harm to yer weapon than it does the critter. Hit it with something blunt or heavy like a morning star or axe.</p>
