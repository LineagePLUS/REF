<p>Hello, <username>.
<br>

<BR>
<P>Did you know that you can set your function keys to perform many actions, such as drinking a potion?</P>
<P>Its quite easy. Simply open your inventory item by pressing the Tab key, or clicking on the bag icon on the lower right of your screen.</P>
<P>Then click, hold, and drag an item to one of the empty function key boxes in the lower right part of the interface. If you drag the item to the F5 slot, you can activate that item by pressing F5 on your keyboard.</P>
<P>Imagine being in a battle with a vicious orc. You can consume a healing potion in the middle of the fight by simply pressing a function key. You should also consider adding a teleport scroll to one of your function keys if you need to escape from danger.</P>


<br>


<p>Always remember that useful information is available at any time by pressing the <font fg=ffffff><a link="help">F1 key.</font></a>
