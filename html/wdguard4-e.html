<p>I shouldn't be saying this out loud...but...did you know that Count Kent came to reign over this territory after the fall of Count Gludia (the original lord of Gludio Estate)?  It was during the war against his highness, Ken Rauhel, the current King of Aden.
<p>The thing is that the newly assigned lord has no concerns for the well being of his domain; no wonder there is <a link=wdguard5>restlessness</a> among the people...
