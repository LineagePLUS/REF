<br>
There are no taxes in Diad Fortress. Because of that, my Lord, you will receive support funds from Aden.
<br>
The funds of Aden will continue as long as you protect this place.
<br>
Each day's funds arrive at Diad Fortress at daybreak.<br>
<br>
The funds are collected from the citizens of Aden as their contribution to the effort to defeat the army of Lastabad.
<br>
Please use them wisely for victory against the army of Lastabad as you protect Diad Fortress.
