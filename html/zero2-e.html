<P>Are you in search of a Prince or Princess to serve?  I believe there are a few things you must note before serving a Prince or Princess.</p>
<P>1. Do not serve one who throws away honor for wealth.</p>
<P>2. Do not serve one who thinks of himself before thinking of the members of the pledge.</p>
<P>3. Do not serve one who acts rashly without discrimination.</p>
<P>4. Do not serve one whose actions differ from their words.</p>
<P>I wish you luck in your pursuit to find a worthy Prince or Princess.</p>
