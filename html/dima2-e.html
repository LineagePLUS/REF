<p>Everybody seems to believe that the Ivory Tower is an eight floor structure. But according to what I've heard, the Ivory Tower used to be a ten story building.
<p>Long ago, a wizard was practicing the forbidden black magic on the tenth floor. By mistake, he opened the door connected to the demonic world and in turn allowed powerful monsters into the Ivory Tower from the other dimension. Wizards joined forces to seal those monsters and as a result the ninth and tenth floors were completely destroyed.
<p>Despite their efforts, the wizards could not completely do away with the monsters. All they could do at the time was cast a powerful spell over the tower itself, which sealed the monsters above the fifth floor. 
<p>According to some people, however, the ninth and tenth floors of the Ivory Tower were not really destroyed, but only transferred over to the demonic world. These people insist that invaluable amounts of treasure are buried there. So, if anyone can defeat all the monsters in the Ivory Tower and return the tower to its original condition, he or she will win enormous wealth.
