<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Mother of the Forest and Elves:</p></font>
<br>
<p>Pan: kind in heart but hot-tempered... Fairy: always bright and joyous... Arachne: the ones who are harsh but care about us the most... And Ent: the wisest and most reserved. These are the guardians.</p>
<p>They maintain order in the forest and provide many of the things we need.  We can't survive without the thread from arachnes or pure mithril from the fairies. The skill of <a link="mothere9">Nerupa</a>, an elder of the Arachne tribe who lives with me, is especially helpful.</p>
<p>They patrol the forest to prevent human contamination. Humans who don't heed their warnings and enter the forest could suffer greatly.</p>
