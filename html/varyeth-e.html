<p>Come on in. How do you like our Ivory Tower?
<p>Oh, by the way, my name is Varyeth. I don't know how, but I have come to be favored by Master Talass, the highest elder, and so I am able to work on various magical experiments here.
<p>My main field of interest deals in the changes and evolution of existing magic.
<p>...To be frank, I am not yet quite up to developing totally new magical methods. Ha, ha.
<br>
<p>But do tell me if you are interested in such magic.
<p>The magic I work on is not so grand as to need a separate store for selling its related goods. Instead, I just do a small business on the side, making a few adena to support my laboratory expenses.
<p>A bit meager, don't you think?
<p>So, if you need anything among the scrolls that I am in charge of, just ask me. And have a nice time at the Ivory Tower.
<p>Oh, yes... and do be on your guard from level four and above.
