<p>As a general rule, if you have good armor you will be better prepared to fight battles and less likely to be injured by enemies. Unfortunately, fighting is not so predictable.  There are always surprises and there will come a time when you are wounded. There are additional measures you can take to protect yourself.
<br>
<p>Potions are a great defense, especially when your hit points and mana are dangerously low.  Of course the potion I just mentioned is a basic one that heals wounds and, yes, you drink it. Traveling without one of the healing types of potion is quite risky. In order to drink the potion, like most other items, <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> on the item window. 
<br>
<p>Healing is just one of the types of potions available.  There are potions, such as cure poison, to recover from poisonous infection and potions, such as haste, used to aid you by increasing your speed. If you are prepared and have all the different varieties of potions, you will be ready for most emergency situations.  One further word of advice, a small amount of time is required for the effects to appear, so don't wait until the very last minute to drink the potion.
