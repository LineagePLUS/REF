You will heal faster if you are well fed. Your nutrition state is displayed on the lower left of the screen--it has an icon that looks like a piece of meat.
<br><br>
To obtain meat, you should talk to a merchant or hunt certain wild animals. Rabbits and deer often drop meat.
<br><br>
When you eat meat, you'll see your nutrition bar increase. To eat meat, or use an item, open your inventory and double-click the item.
