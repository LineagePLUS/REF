<p>Just as your highness once did, there are many groups who are planning to take over this castle right now. So if you want to remain as the lord of this castle, you will have to take care of them wisely.
<p>Once you take over the castle, you have to adjust the taxes so that there is enough money to maintain it, repairing that which is destroyed during the war. And once you have enough money to repair the inner and outer gates (thus strengthening the integrity of the castle), you should hire mercenaries so that the enemies cannot come near you.
<p>After taking the castle, other Blood Pledges will try to challenge your authority. For them, you must set a war time with me. You can change this time freely if it is done before half of the day passes after first conquering the castle.  But once this time passes, you can't change the time any more. If you don't set the time, it will be set automatically to approximately ten days later.
<p>Once the time arrives, you must defend the castle until sunset. Even if you lose your castle temporarily, you just need to get it back before sunset and the castle remains yours. After sunset, you must set the next siege time again.
<br>
<p>Once the war starts, it is best to block the entrance into the outer castle. The outer gate is very strong and the archers will defend the gate. But since you can't always leave the outer gate closed, you must not assume that they will always come from the outside. In this case, don't forget about the other means of protection: the inner gate, though not as sturdy as the outer gate.
<p>Furthermore, no one can make sure that enemies won't infiltrate the inner castle. So please my lord, always take enough mercenaries with you as bodyguards.
<p>Now the most obvious way to lose your castle is by meeting an untimely death at the hands of enemies. But 'tis not the only way to lose the castle. If the enemy prince takes over your throne, you will lose it as well.
<p>If I may say so, the loser's fate is a horrible one, my lord. Please be wise when dealing with affairs of war.
