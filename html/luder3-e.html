<p>Are you curious about having conversations?  In fact, this is the easiest thing to do. It's so simple! All you need to do is type in the words you wish to say in the Chat Window at the bottom of the screen and press Enter.
<br>
<p>Try it just once and you will know how to do it exactly. For now, this method of talking will give you no inconvenience in conversing with others. But wait, once you befriend someone, you will want to do more than this common talking.  For example, you may have some sort of secret you want to whisper only for their ears. Am I right?
<p>Try typing <font fg=ffffff>"[Listener's name] [What you want to say].</font> Then nobody else will be able to hear your voice, except of course the friend you are confiding in.
<p>For example, if you type <font fg=ffffff>"Luder I am grateful to you,</font> you have just sent your words of thanks to me and ONLY me -- without anyone else eavesdropping on us. Yes, that's right! And you are a polite one, aren't you?  Ha, ha, ha!
