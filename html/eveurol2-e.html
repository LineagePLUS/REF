<br>
<p>This subterranean temple is where we carry out ceremonies for Eva. At the same time, this place also acts as the seal to protect Heine from Fafurion and his polluted children of the water. We are constantly inspecting the subterranean waterway and the ruins at the bottom of the lake to ensure our safety and we support adventurers traveling to the lake bottom.</p>
