<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Chamberlain Orville:</p></font>
<br>
<p>My Lord <var src="#0">, you are the lord of this castle. And I have been in charge of this castle since it was called Gludio. I know about this castle and lands around better than anyone else.
<p>So even though there have been many lord successions since I became the Chamberlain of this castle, I always helped them defend the castle and lands regardless of who they were.
<p>My loyalty is not restricted to one specific person but to the lord of the Gludio Estate. Thus, as long as you are the lord of this castle, I'll be always loyal to you.
<p>You can gather taxes and hire mercenaries through me, thus ruling this province with supreme power. But considering the life of the people here, please don't abuse your power...and take good care of the land and people.
<p>And just in case, please remember that as a lord of this province you can't really leave the world entirely. If you leave this world, your avatar will appear at the exact place you departed. The avatar accepts all wars against you. Furthermore he is vulnerable to external dangers. So I advise you to come to the safe place before leaving the world. Someone may try to kill your avatar while you are absent.
