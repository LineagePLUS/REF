<p>Haven't you heard the rumors? The story is, the son of King Duke Dephil and Queen Gadria was hidden by the King's Blood Pledge for his protection. Furthermore, there is a rumor that he will return to the Kingdom of Aden to reclaim his right to the throne.
<p>Whether he will be a good king or not...now that's another story...but how much worse could it be?
