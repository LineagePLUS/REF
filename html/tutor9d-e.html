Buying, Selling, and Trading Items: 
<BR><BR>
You should improve your weapons and armor as you advance. You can do this by buying, finding, selling, or trading other items (weapons, money, potions, etc.). Monsters sometimes drop items or money (adena) that you can pick up and use, sell, or trade to another player or NPC merchant.

Buying from NPCs: 
<BR><BR>

Click on the NPC. 
Click the Buy button. 
Click on the desired item from the list. (If you click on the icon, the item's attributes will appear in a window.) 
Type the quantity you want to buy in the text entry field, or use the arrows in the list of goods. 
Repeat selection and quantity for each item you want. 
Click the Buy button. 
Press the Tab key to review your item window for the new items.

Selling to NPCs: 
<BR><BR>

Click on the NPC. 
Click the Sell button. 
Click on the desired item from the list. 
Type the quantity you want to sell, or use the arrows in the list of goods. 
Repeat selection and quantity for each item you are selling. 
Click the Sell button. 
<BR><BR>
Note: Items that are easily found in-game (candles, daggers, leather jackets) are unlikely to be purchased by merchants. When you sell items, a list of the items in your inventory that the merchant is interested in will appear. If the merchant does not want to buy any of your items, he or she will tell you.
