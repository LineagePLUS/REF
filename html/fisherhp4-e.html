<p>I can take care of all the details concerning the castle so you don't have to pay attention to such petty things. But you will have to instruct me regarding the management of the castle gates during war.<br>
<p>There are two gates in this castle -- the inner gate and the outer gate. The inner gate leads out from the inner castle (where you are standing right now). The outer gate is the one located in the outer castle wall, which surrounds this inner castle. 
<p>You or the members of your Blood Pledge can order the gatekeeper to open and close the respective inner gate. But you should guard your Blood Pledge members carefully as the opening of the castle gates is directly related to the security of the whole castle. 
<p>If you open the outer gate, it will allow enemies to come into the inner castle, so beware. But if you keep the gates closed too much, citizens of your territory will be unable to use the facilities in the castle such as the blacksmith shop. Since the facilities in the castle are an important source of castle income, it could cause financial disaster if they are inaccessible to your subjects. You must consider this when deciding to open and close the gates.  <br>
<p>Both gates can be destroyed by an assault from attackers during siege or war. If you leave the outer gates broken it is very dangerous in battle, so be sure to fix them if the conditions allow. 
<p>The gates can only be fixed when we are in a time of peace.  If a siege occurs, or if war breaks out during repairs, the work must be suspended. Of course, it costs money to fix the castle gates too.  If they are completely destroyed, it can cost thousands of adena to repair them. Therefore, keep these points in mind and be wise in your judgment. 
<p>If you order the castle gates to be repaired automatically, they will be repaired immediately, even without your command. However, keep in mind that the costs for the repairs will be expended too and that repairs must halt during a siege.
