<p>Do you have someone who loves you so much that they would die for you? If so, you're a very lucky person.
<p>I have seen many couples unite at the cathedral.  They pledge their vows to one another in front of Einhasad and all of their friends. The couples usually radiate with happiness, I hope it lasts...
<p>I wonder if I will ever meet a person worthy of sharing my life... It would be exciting to have a wedding in the cathedral but it would take a special person.
