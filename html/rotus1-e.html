<p>General Lazloth of the border camp is a truly great man. Lately, many Knights have been coming to Oren just to meet him.
<p>Having excellent skills, he is responsible for the border camp - and he's modest too. Isn't he a great man?
<p>Oh, by the way, one of those Knights said something to me recently. He asked whether I had heard about some <a link="rotus2">top quality armor</a>... said it was comparable to a suit of armor made out of dragon scales and supposedly stronger than diamonds.
