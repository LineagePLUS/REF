For my Ivory Tower graduate research, I am looking into ways of polymorphing into monsters that could not be transformed into before. If you wish, I can transform you into a monster for a certain period of time. You will have the appearance of the monster for 30 minutes.
<br>During the polymorphing time, you will also gain some of the monster's characteristics. 
<br>
Oh, and you'll need to prepare 200 adena for me as payment for the ingredients of the magic.
