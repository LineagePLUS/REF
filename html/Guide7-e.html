Form a party and I shall reward you with a small shield.

A hunting party is an informal group of players banded together to help each other kill monsters and gather treasure. To create a hunting party:
<br>* Hold the Shift key and click at the feet of the other player to face the person you want to hunt with.
<br>* Click on the community icon or type /invite. He or she will be asked if they want to join the party. If they type Y and press Enter; they will be in your party and you will see a red line over your hunting partners. This is the health indicator for each player in the party – you can now tell whether or not a player in your party needs some help, or needs to regenerate HP. The person who starts the hunting party is the only person who may invite others to join.
<br><br>You may leave the hunting party at any time through use of the community icon or /outparty command.
