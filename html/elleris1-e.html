<p>Come on in! I am Wizard Elleris who has been dispatched here from the Ivory Tower of Oren.
<p>The Ivory Tower of Oren carries out various services in order to put magic to use for the public good.
<p>But there is one thing you must keep in mind. Here in Aden, for the purpose of security in the capital city, there are limitations on teleporting.
<p>Thus, I can send people to other places that they want to go but they are not able to teleport back to Aden.
<p>OK, so where do you want to go?
