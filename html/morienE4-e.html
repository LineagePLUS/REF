<p>Arachnes can make anything; watching them spinning thread is really fabulous. The threads have high resilience and strength, and are usually used for bowstrings, clothes, gloves, and boots. Actually, we can't ignore the quality of <a link="morienE7">pan's mane</a>, the material for the threads...but it is arachnes who are actually spinning the them. They are quite talented!</p>
