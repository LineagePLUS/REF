<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Dicarding:</p></font> <br>Do you know that the Dark Elves have existed in this world since very long ago? <br><br>From what I know about the classics, the Dark Elves were originally of the same tribe as the Elves in the Elven Forest. But there were some Elves that abandoned their creator, Einhasad, due to an ancient war and worshipped Gran Kain. They ended up being cursed by Einhasad and were chased away and fled underground. You could say that this war was prophesied since very long ago...<br><br> They have shown strong unity in this war and so I feel that they are somehow organized in a similar organizational structure as our Human society. And so this means that it clearly is not only because of the influence of the dark god Gran Kain.<br> We can infer that they have a leader with strong charisma and wisdom that is rallying and managing their organization.<br><br> I'm really worried about it. I wonder if the young people of today will be able to unify to deal with this calamity... <br><br> <img src="#331" link="dicarding"></img>
