<p>There are already guards posted to maintain justice around the castle, but they are to maintain justice only, and are not of use during war. Considering that there are many small and large conflicts in the estate, we'd better prepare for the worst by hiring trustworthy mercenaries.
<p>Once you tell me the number and type of mercenaries, I'll ask around to gather trustworthy mercenaries that will be available at the hour of request, the following day.
<p>There are two types of mercenaries that can defend our castle. One is the archer, who can shoot against enemies trying to destroy the castle gate. The other is a personal bodyguard to protect you and members of your Blood Pledge.
<p>I will arrange archers around the castle wall as soon as they are ready, but you have to decide for yourself how many bodyguards will be assigned to you and your members.
<p>Mercenaries will await your orders in the barracks at the south corner of the outer castle. Once you make up your mind, talk to Hunt, the captain of the mercenary army <var src="#0">. He will assign mercenaries according to your orders.
<br>
<p>Please remember that the money to hire mercenaries will come from the taxes gathered from residents of your land.
