<p>Our town is in the Northern (Black) Forest.
<p>Originally people shunned the area because of the northern orc tribes, but after the recent war, in which that evil Pretender King swept the Gludio Estates, many people who had lost their homes and farms entered that forest and cultivated the ground by burning the trees.  It's a relatively new town.
<p>Northern orcs are constantly invading the town to claim their forest... but we don't have any choice.
