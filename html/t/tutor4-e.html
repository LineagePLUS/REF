<p>Hello, <username>.
<br><br>
I am your combat instructor.

To fight a creature, position your Cursor over it. The Cursor will change to a sword icon. Click to attack. Each time you click (or click and hold) on the enemy you will attack until the battle is over. Make sure you have armed yourself first! 
<BR><BR>
Now, try bangin' on this training dummy to my left.  It is a good way for a novice to get a bit of experience. However, it'll only help you for the first couple levels.

If you need to attack an NPC, position your Cursor over him. Hold the Ctrl key (the Cursor will change from a mouth to a sword icon) and click to attack. Attacking peaceful NPCs can result in unpleasant repercussions to your character, up to and including death at the hands of guards. 
<BR>

<p>At some point, you will likely be defeated in battle. You should be prepared for this risk.</P>
