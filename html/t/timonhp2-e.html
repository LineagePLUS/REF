<br>
<p>Your Highness <var src="#0">, you are not only the Lord of this castle but you are also King of the great kingdom of Aden. 
<p>Many, including the Pretender King, have held the position of King and then lost it. I have always protected the King - whoever he may be - and watched over the castle and territory for the sake of the kingdom.
<p>My loyalty lies not with an individual but with the King of Aden. Therefore, I swear my allegiance to you for as long as you are Lord of this place. 
<p>You will collect taxes through me and summon and deploy Royal Guards with that money to become the most powerful person in this land, but you must not abuse your power. I entreat you to rule your dominion wisely, keeping the citizens of this region in mind. 
<p>Lastly, and I am only saying this out of kindness, as the King of Aden, Your Highness will always exist in this world. Even when you leave this world, your spirit will remain here and, except for unavoidable circumstances, it will accept all wars that challenge you. Therefore, under no circumstances should you wander around outside the castle unprotected. And when leaving this world, always do so in a safe place, for a king has many enemies.
