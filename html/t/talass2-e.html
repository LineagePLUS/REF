<p>...Sayha's bow... I don't know where you heard that name...
<p>Yes, I do know how to make that magical bow which is named after a god.
<p>And no, to be more exact, there is no other being in this world besides me capable of making that bow.
<br>
<p>The bow gets its name from Sayha, goddess of the winds. The bow has potential far greater than any bow you have ever seen.
<p>The force of its spirit is so mighty that a normal human cannot even make use of it. 
<p>The only beings able to use Sayha's bow are Elves who can truly become one with the forces of nature.
<p>An ordinary human who dares to use the bow will be unable to endure its great power and only end up hurting himself...
<br>
<p>The most distinguishing characteristic of Sayha's bow is the tremendous power of the wind hidden in the bow.
<br>
<p>You can imagine that a bow with a reputation like this is awfully difficult to make.
<p>If you bring me the necessary ingredients, I'll make the bow for you... but most people give up when they hear what's required.
<p>Four types of material are necessary to make the bow.
<p>First, to make the basic skeleton of the bow, we need a Yumi Bow. Frankly, this is pretty easy.
<p>However, all of the other ingredients are extremely rare.
<p>You need 30 griffon feathers - but ordinary feathers won't do. 
<p>You've got to find silvery, shiny feathers. My guess is that you will have to kill dozens of griffons before you come close to finding one silver feather. I'm not kidding when I say that such feathers are scarce.
<p>Another ingredient is a small, transparent jewel called the Tear of Wind. It's a luminous jewel blessed by the Spirit of the Wind and passed down by the Elves through the ages. From what I have heard, there aren't any left in this world.
<p>They say that all the remaining Tears of Wind had been gathered and stored together but were stolen by the dark Elves several decades ago.
<p>And the fifty Tears of Winds required for this will seem like a walk in the park compared to the last ingredient... 
<p>The final ingredient is 15 of the wind dragon Lindvior's scales...
<br>
<p>I do not think it is possible, but if you can manage to gather all of the abovementioned ingredients, I will make the bow for you.
