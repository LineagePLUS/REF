<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Chamberlain Timon:</p></font>
<br>
<p>You have the power of taxation over the citizens of the kingdom of Aden.
<p>Though Your Highness manages the taxes of the entire kingdom, in an immediate sense, you have the power to directly adjust the tax rates only in the area around Aden Castle.
<p>When Your Highness decrees a tax rate, it will be effective for the tax collections on the next day. In the event that you change the rate more than once in a day, the last rate that you set will be applied on the following day. 
<p>The day's taxes will be collected and brought to the castle by daybreak of the next day.<br>
<p>All collected taxes belong to Your Highness. However, you cannot use the tax income as you wish. This is because money is needed for various tasks of operating the nation.<br>
<p>Of course the higher the tax rate, the fuller the castle vault, but if the tax rate is too high, prices will rise and the citizens will come to oppose you. Please always keep this in mind as you adjust the tax rates.
