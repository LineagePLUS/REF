<p>Hi! Judging from that long sword you have in your hand, you must be a knight.</p>
<p>I am an apprentice knight and my mentor is in Silver Knight Town at the moment. Are you new to our town? Then have you by any chance heard about the underground dungeon?</p> 
<p>From what my mentor has told me, that place is completely wrapped in a tragic past. I was severely scolded for sneaking out there on the day of the knight commissioning ceremony. Though I did not get a chance to go deep inside the underground dungeon, the scary feeling... well, something seemed to be lurking inside.</p>
