<p>The battle against the orc tribe is more fierce than ever.<br>
You may think of orcs as ordinary and not very strong but the orcs in this forest differ from the usual.<br>
They are both larger and smarter. It even makes me wonder if I'm thinking of the same dull folks when I see them fight in groups under the coordination of the Atuba Tribe, which is the leading tribe.<br><br>
Anyway, the reason that fighting with those orcs has become fiercer recently seems to be because of the Dark Elven army. However, I have my doubts that the Dark Elves really are enemies of the orcs.<br>
I'd like to see them fight against each other.<br>Wouldn't that be nice? When they fight against each other and then get tired, we'd be able to completely wipe them out.
