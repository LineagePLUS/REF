<p>Hello, <username>.
<br>

<BR>
There are two types of magic: regular magic and spirit magic. While Wizards, Princes/Princesses, and Elves can all learn certain levels of magic, spirit magic may only be learned by Elves. 
<BR><BR>
Magic spells are accessed through your magic window. To open your magic window, press Ctrl-S, or click on the magic (cross) icon. 
<br><br>
To cast a spell: 
<br>
Find the spell you want to use and double-click on it to cast it. 
<br>
If asked to select a target, place your Cursor over the character you want to cast the spell on and click. 
<br>
Spells can also be mapped to shortcuts F5 through F12 by dragging and dropping them from your magic window into the shortcut keys on the game interface. When you use the shortcuts for spells, you can just press the appropriate function key to cast them. Certain first level spells are mapped to your F9-12 keys by default, but you can configure your spell shortcuts any way you choose. You may also map potions and other items to your shortcut keys. 
<BR><BR>
When spells are cast, they use up a certain amount of mana points (MP). There are many scrolls and potions that do the same thing as spells, but do not use mana. If you have a lesser healing potion and the capability to cast a lesser heal spell on yourself, it might be wise to save your MP for other spells and use the lesser healing potion. 
<BR><br>
Although you primarily consume spiritual power (mana) when casting spells, take note -- some spells require the caster's physical power (hit points) and may significantly affect your body. Other spells require ingredients (magic gems and spirit gems) in order to be cast. 
<BR><BR>
Remember to manage your food and weight gauges when using magic. Mana points in combat can be used very quickly. If your food gauge is low and your weight is high, you will have difficulty regenerating HP and MP. Keep yourself well-fed and do not collect many heavy objects (you can store them or sell them, if you wish). MP does not regenerate if your weight bar is red. 
<BR><BR>
"MP/HP/I" refers to the mana points/hit points/ingredients required to cast the spell. Ingredients are magic gems (for regular magic) and spirit gems (for spirit, or Elven, magic).
