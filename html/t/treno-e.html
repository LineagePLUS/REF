<p>There are no extremely powerful monsters on this island. Nonetheless, you should still be cautious. Whenever you are injured, come straight to me. I have no great abilities, but since all I do is treat injuries I am willing to apply my talents. Need I bother telling you that it is best not to get wounded in the first place?  I provide cures solely as a service and no money payments are necessary.
