The Prince or Princess is an advanced class. They are weaker than Knights and have less magical abilities than the Wizard. However, they are the only class that can create and manage a Blood Pledge.
<BR> 
Good Princes should have plenty of charisma to increase the number of members they can have in their Blood Pledge. They may lead their companions to take over the various castles and lands in the world of Lineage.
<BR>
Fortunately, those of royal blood can also use most weapons and armor. They begin their quest to regain the throne on Singing Island.
