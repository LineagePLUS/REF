<p>Hello, <username>.
<BR><BR>
Time to learn some communication skills!

<P>You can chat simply by typing a message and pressing your Enter key. Try that now.</P>
<P>See the overhead chat? Anyone in your screen can hear you.
<p>You can also "shout" to all players slightly outside your screen by beginning the sentence with an exclamation point (!). This uses nourishment, though, so make sure you are well fed when shouting.</P>
<P>To tell a secret, you may whisper to a specific player by starting the sentence with the quote (") key and typing the intended listener's name: "[name] [message]. This way only the intended recipient will hear you.
There are other ways to communicate as well.
