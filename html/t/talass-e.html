<p>What do you seek coming all the way here, adventurer?<br>
Traveling to this place in the middle of nowhere... are you another person who has lost his soul to magic? Or are you trying to understand the ways of magic for a more complete path of the sword?<br><br>
I am Talass, the highest of the Ivory Tower's elders.

The Ivory Tower is not as fascinating as people on the outside make it sound. As a center for magic it does have its fair share of attractions, though. Take your time and look around.
