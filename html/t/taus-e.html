<p>Welcome to the Ivory Tower.
<p>This is the Ivory Tower which you could say is the magic capital of the world. It is a treasure trove of knowledge that almost all of the Wizards in the Kingdom of Aden pass through. 
<br>
<p>Let me give you a brief explanation about the tower.
<p>Here on the first level are the reception room and the spirit magic training room that is open to Elves who wish to receive training in spirit magic. You do not need to bother traveling all the way home to the Mother Tree to evoke the forces in the spirit crystals for learning magic. And if you are looking for spirit magic rediscovered by master Ellyonne, try the shops located here. The same stores also deal in general magic products.
<p>The second level is where the personal laboratories of the Wizards are located. If there is a type of magic for Wizards you need, you will find it here.
<p>The personal quarters of Master Talass, the Ivory Tower's highest elder, and the magic training room are on the third level. This training room is a place where you can learn magic without having to go to the temple in person.
<br>
<p>From the fourth level and above, you need to be more careful. Levels four and five are where the Wizards carry out their experiments on magical creatures. Though they are not that strong, monsters roam about and the area is completely different from the third level, so please pay careful attention if you go there.
<p>Finally, from the sixth level to the eighth at the top, extra special care is mandatory. That is where the monsters that escaped from the evil world are sealed.
<p>The place is so dangerous that it is beyond comparison with the fourth level. Unless you are absolutely sure of your abilities, refrain from entering.
<p>Once again, thank you for visiting the Ivory Tower.
