The Elven race inhabits the Elven Forest, located in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Aden. 
<BR>
The Elf is considered an advanced class. They must construct many of their own items, as vendors are not available as they are where human classes begin play. The Elven Forest 
is their training ground, so they must gain experience through combat. The guardians of the forest help Elves in this area.

<BR>
Elves have some distinct advantages. They are naturally dexterous, and this is a great aid to those who choose to follow the path of archery.  Additionally, Elves are second only to human Wizards in their magic abilities. Some are quite intelligent and wise, which supports their tendency to excel in this field. Elves also have infravision, which allows them to see clearly even in the darkest dungeon.
