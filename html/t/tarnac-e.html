<p>You wish to know of the northern castle?
<br>
<p>It is said evil Elindare lurks the castle halls, planning her destruction of all of Aden. Even now she sends her fiends out to terrorize the people.  Some have even whispered that she calls for the sea creatures to do her bidding. I shudder at the thought.
<br>
<p>Seek out Melinda, for she knows more of Elindare's past...
