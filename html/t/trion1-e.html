Once before when I was young -- I do not remember when exactly -- I tried to go to Aden to see Aden Castle. Then I lost my way and ended up in the <font fg=ffffff>Forest of Mirrors</font>. When I was there, I saw monsters called <font fg=ffffff>Doppelgangers</font> that looked just like me!<br> Ah, ah... It was so scary that I still have nightmares about it sometimes. But those monsters are nothing compared to the Dark Elven army that is going around slaughtering now.<br>
Still, it's fortunate that people are joining together to fight and it seems that the Dark Elven forces have subsided a lot recently. That really must be good news.
