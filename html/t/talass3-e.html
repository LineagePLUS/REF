<p>The history of the Ivory Tower is often said to parallel the history of human magic.
<p>Did you know that? Who do you think we humans learned magic from?
<p>The answer is Elves.
<p>Though Elves are not quite as good as the Wizards who have had special training in the tower, Elves are the ones who taught us magic in the first place. Is it easy to believe that Elves were our teachers?
<p>I think such a point is man's best quality. Humans can absorb any ability and improve it to a level surpassing the original.  
<p>But then, this is also the Achilles heel of humans. In the process of improvement, humans step on so many things and sometimes ruin them.
<br>
<p>Doing all we can to stand in a position superior to all others... that pretty much sums up the human race.
<p>On the other hand, Elves always wish to progress with the infinite flow of nature. They do not seek the fire-like development of humans. Instead, they want to evolve like the flowing water.
<p>Modest Ellyonne insists he only rediscovered the magic of the past that had disappeared, but I disagree. He is the true creator of spirit magic.
<br>
<p>Please do not misunderstand me. I am not trying to say that Elves are better than humans, or that the human race is vulgar.
<p>The two groups are clearly and fundamentally different but yet they have spent countless years together and they sometimes learn from each other.
<p>If Elves and humans continue their comradeship, who knows? Perhaps they will be able to create a new magic system that fuses Wizard's magic with spirit magic.
<br>
<p>...Goodness, I have been going on forever with this boring long-winded story.
<p>I do apologize. Now that I am old and visitors are limited, adventurers like you who visit from time to time are most welcome.
