<p>Our refined and skillful crafting can produce anything, but we take great pride in spinning thread. Especially the <font fg=ffffff>thread</font> of <font fg=ffffff>Pan's mane</font> - which has high resilience and strength.  It can be even used in making Elven <font fg=ffffff>bows, clothes, cloaks, gloves, and even boots</font>. Someday, you may be able to use such garments yourself!</p>
