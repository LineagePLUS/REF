<p>What are you living for? In your life until now, is there nothing you've done that you regret?</p>
<br>
<p>I... recently... am starting to doubt... the things I did in the past. Indeed, I am shedding tears of regret.</p> 
<p>For what reason... did I take life? I really don't have any idea why I took such a precious thing from so many.</p> 
<p>And, why am I alive?</p> 
<p>Could it be that when I face death at a certain point in time... that I will regret everything I did in the past? Is there anyone that will shed a tear for me?</p> 
<br>
<p>Somebody... always gives me more work. Whether or not those tasks are for good or evil...</p>
<p>In the past, I acted without even the right to judge... I carried out those tasks based on a silent threat.</p>
<br>
<p>Ronde told me once that we are walking the upright path...</p>
<p>Bludika also told me that we are setting right the wrongs of the past...</p>
<p>But, still, I want to be more than just a puppet for Ronde and Bludika.</p>
