<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Window:</font>
<p>Press the <font fg=ffffff>Ctrl-S</font> key to bring up the magic window at any time.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Remembering Teleport Locations:</font>
<p>You can use the scroll of teleportation and a ring of teleport control to teleport to a place you have been before.</p>
<p>Remember your present location by entering <font fg=ffffff>"/bookmark [name of location]"</font> into the chatline. Next time you use a teleport scroll or spell while equipped with the ring of teleport control or a blessed scroll of teleportation, this bookmark list will appear. Double-click the place of your choice and you can teleport to that location immediately.</p>
<p>If you just type <font fg=ffffff>"/bookmark"</font>, you will see the list of places you have in your memory.</p>
<p>To remove a place from your list, all you have to do is choose the location to delete from the list and then press the <font fg=ffffff>Delete </font> key.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Magic Shortcut Keys:</font>
<p>Just as with items, you can assign different magic spells to the F5 - F12 keys. To make a shortcut, enter <font fg=ffffff>"/F(5-12) [Name of magic spell]"</font> in the chatline. Another method of making a shortcut is to open the magic window and <font fg=ffffff>drag the magic icon</font> for the appropriate spell to the respective slot in the shortcut key window at the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Switching to Spell Mode:</font>
<p>You can switch to spell mode by pressing the <font fg=ffffff>Ctrl-X</font> key. While in spell mode, you will see the last spell you used appear in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. You can automatically cast a spell by simply clicking on a target. (Keep in mind though, that when starting the game, you won't have used magic yet and so there won't be any magic in memory.) If you press the Ctrl-X key again, spell mode ends and you can resume normal attacks.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Forced Magic Attack:</font>
<p>If you are not in spell mode, you can still cast spells on a PC by pressing the Ctrl key.</p>
