<p>Haven't you been there? There are steps going down in the next room. This castle was originally built by Karel, the Blue Knight of Betrayal, who also wanted to seal the monsters in the dungeon. Up until now, there have been no real dangers, but the monsters in the dungeon are threatening the castle endlessly. Because of those monsters, this dungeon serves as a training ground for young Knights.</p>
<br>
<p>It may be hard to believe that he built a castle in the center of danger, but he always said that having danger nearby prevents internal corruption and teaches a strong mind. Most of all, he wanted to build Windawood as the place where commoners can live comfortably without worrying about monsters.
<br>Karel was quite a lord.</p>
