<p>As your highness did once, there are many groups who are planning to take over this castle outside right now. So if you want to remain as the lord of this castle, you have to take care of them wisely.
<p>Once you take over the castle, you have to adjust the tax so that there is enough money to repair it after the war. And once you have enough money, you have to repair the inner and outer gate to strengthen the integrity of castle. You'd better hire mercenaries so that the enemies can't come near you.
<p>After taking the castle, other Blood Pledges will try to challenge your authority. You must set the next war time through me. You can change this time freely before half of the day passes after conquering the castle...but once this time passes, you can't change the time any more. If you don't set the time until then, the time will be set automatically to about 10 days later.
<p>Once the time comes, you have to defend the castle until sunset. Even if you lose your castle temporarily, you just have to get it back before sunset, then the castle is yours. After sunset, you have to set the next siege time again.
<br>
<p>Once the war starts, it's better to block the entrance into the outer castle. The outer gate is very strong and the archers will defend the gate, but since you can't always leave the outer gate closed, you must not assume that they will always come from the outside. To deal with this, there is another protective gate - the inner gate - but it's not as sturdy as the outer gate.
<p>Furthermore, no one can make sure that the enemy won't infiltrate into the inner castle. So please my lord, always take enough mercenaries with you as bodyguards.
<p>Now the most horrific way to lose your castle is, well... meeting an untimely death by the hands of enemies. However, that's not the only way to lose the castle. If the enemy Prince takes over your throne, you will lose also.
<p>If I may say so, the loser's fate is unthinkable, my lord. Please be wise when dealing with matters of war.
