<p>I can take care of all the bureaucratic affairs of the castle, so you need not pay attention to such things. But I will need instructions regarding the management of the castle gates during war.
<p>There are two gates in this castle, the inner gate and the outer gate. The inner gate is the one between this inner castle (where you are standing right now) and the outside. The outer gate is located in the outer castle wall, which surrounds the inner castle.
<p>As a convenience, you and your followers can open/close the inner gate through the gatekeeper next to it. But the outer gate, which is directly related to the security of the whole castle, is accessible to your highness only.  Please order me if you want to open or close the outer gate.
<p>If you open the outer gate, it will allow enemies to come into the inner castle, so it's very dangerous. But if you keep the gate closed too long, people will be unable to use the facilities in the castle such as the forge. Since they are the main sources of castle treasury, it could cause financial problems. So you must calculate carefully when you would like me to close the gate.
<p>Furthermore, both gates can be destroyed by assaults from infiltrators during war. Once the gates are destroyed, they can be fixed only after the war ends. If the war occurs during the repairs, we must stop the repair work. And, of course, it costs money to repair the gates. When the gate is destroyed completely, it could cost thousands of adena. You have to decide when we will fix the gates based on these considerations.
