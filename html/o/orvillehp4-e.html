<p>I can take care of all the detailed affairs of the castle so you don't have to pay attention to such things. But you will have to instruct me regarding the management of the castle gates during war.
<p>There are two gates in this castle -- the inner gate and the outer gate. The inner gate is the one leading out from this inner castle where you are standing right now. The outer gate is the one located in the outer castle wall which surrounds this inner castle.
<p>You or the members of your Blood Pledge can order the gatekeeper at each gate to open and close the respective inner gate. But you should guard your blood Pledge members carefully as the opening of the castle gates is directly related to the security of the whole castle.
<p>If you open the outer gate, it will allow enemies to come into the inner castle, so it's very dangerous. But if you kept the gates closed too much, citizens of your territory will be unable to use the facilities in the castle such as the blacksmith shop. Since the facilities in the castle are an important source of castle income, it could cause financial problems if they are inaccessible to your subjects. So you must consider carefully when to open and close the gates based on these points.
<p>Furthermore, both gates can be destroyed by an assault from attackers during war. If you leave the outer gates broken it is very dangerous in war so you should be sure to fix them if the conditions allow. 
<p> However, the gates can only be fixed when war is not underway and if a war breaks out during repairs, the work must be suspended. Of course, it costs money to fix the castle gates too and if they are completely destroyed, it can cost thousands of adena to repair them. Therefore, keep these points in mind and be wise in your judgment regarding whether to fix them or not. 
<p>If you order that the castle gates be fixed automatically, they will be repaired after breaking, even without your command. However, keep in mind that the costs for the repairs will be expended too and that this command cannot be carried out during a siege.
