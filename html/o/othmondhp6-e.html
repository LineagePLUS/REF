<p>Like your highness recently did, there are many groups planning to take over this castle right now. So if you want to remain as the lord of this castle, you will have to deal with them appropriately.
<p>Once you take over the castle, you have to adjust the tax so that there is enough money to repair the castle, which was damaged during the war. And once you have enough money, you will have to repair the inner and outer gates to strengthen the integrity of the castle. You should hire mercenaries as well so that the enemies can't come near you.
<p>After taking the castle, other Blood Pledges will attempt to challenge your authority. For them, you must set the next siege time with me. You can change this time freely before half of the day passes after conquering the castle.  But, once this time passes, you cannot change the time again. If you don't set the time 'til after that cut off, the time will be set automatically to about 10 days later.
<p>Once the time arrives, you have to defend the castle until sunset. Even if you lose your castle temporarily, if you get it back before the sun falls, the castle remains in your control. After sunset, you must set the next siege time again.
<br>
<p>Once the siege starts, it is best to block the entrance into the outer castle. The outer gate is very strong and the archers will defend the gate, but since you can't always leave the outer gate closed, you must not assume that the enemies will always come from the outside. To deal with this case, there is an another protection -- the inner gate.  It is not as sturdy as the outer gate, however.
<p>Furthermore, it cannot be certain that they won't infiltrate into the inner castle. So please, my lord, always take enough mercenaries with you as bodyguards.
<p>Now the most dreadful way to lose your castle is, well... to meet an unfortunate demise at the hands of enemies, of course. But that's not the only way to lose the castle...if the enemy Prince takes over your throne, you will also be defeated.
<p>If I may say so, the fate of the loser is unthinkable, my lord. Please be wise when dealing with matters of war.
