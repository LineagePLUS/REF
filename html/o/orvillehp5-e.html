<p>There are already guards posted to maintain the justice around the castle, but they are here to maintain justice only.  We'll be hard-pressed to use them during the war. Considering that there are many small and large conflicts in the estate, we'd better prepare for the worst by hiring the trustworthy mercenaries.
<p>Once you tell me the number and type of mercenaries, I'll ask around to gather trustworthy mercenaries until the next day same hour.
<p>There are two types of mercenaries to defend our castle, considering its structure. One is the archer, who can shoot against the enemies trying to destroy the gate. The other is the personal bodyguard, to protect you and members of your Blood Pledge.
<p>I will arrange archers around the castle wall as soon as they are ready. But you have to decide yourself how many bodyguards will be assigned to you and your members.
<p>Mercenaries will wait for your order in the barracks at the south corner of the outer castle. Once you make up your mind, talk to Hunt, the captain of mercenary army <var src="#0">. Then he will assign mercenaries according to your order.
<br>
<p>Please remember that the money to hire mercenaries also comes from the taxes gathered from the residents of your land.
