<P>I need the historic spellbooks belonging to the Duda-Mara, Gandi, Atuba and Neruga orc tribes. You will find them in the forest to the west of here.</p>
<P>Of course, they will not willingly give up their spellbooks, so be careful.</p>
<P>If you bring me the spellbooks, I will reward you with either a helm of dexterity or a helm of constitution.  When you choose, keep in mind that the helm of dexterity is good for Elves using bows while the helm of constitution is best for Elves wielding swords.</p>
