My father once fell into the ocean and nearly lost his life from the great set of jaws belonging to a creature called <font fg=ffffff>Elekkadom</font>. With heaven's help, he was saved. Not only does this monster bite with its mouth, but it also emits electricity from its tubercles and electrocutes everything around. My father certainly was lucky to have escaped such a creature.</p>
