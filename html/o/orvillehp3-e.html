<br>
<p>It is your royal right to tax the people living here, and it's your responsibility to pay a tribute to Ken Rauhel who is the lord of this kingdom.
<p>You have the power to adjust the tax of this province. The adjusted tax will be applied to the shops in the village around the castle and even the shops in the Gludin village, thus affecting all trades there.
<p>Once you decide the rate of tax, it will be effective the next day. If you change the tax rate several times in a day, the next day's tax rate will be the last one you set that previous day.
<p>Gathered taxes will be transferred to the castle around the dawn of the next day.
<p>All the taxes belong to you, my lord. But, you can't use them all. It costs money to manage the castle and lands...and don't forget the tribute to the king.
<p>The higher you set the tax, the more would come to the castle treasury. But if you raise the tax too much, people will not support you. So please keep that in mind when you adjust the tax.
