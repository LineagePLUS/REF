Four kinds of magic cloaks can be made, each having different properties based on the four cimaera skin types, which are "lion", "dragon", "goat" and "snake". These represent the four elements of "fire", "water", "wind" and "earth", respectively. Then the cloaks can be further refined using various kinds of gems. Indeed... alchemy is something that cannot be learned without adequate intelligence.

You'll need some very special ingredients to make a magic cloak. Three dragon scales corresponding to the element you desire are needed to make the cloak.
