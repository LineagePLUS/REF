<p>As you can see, I'm a sailor. I used to work on the ship between here and Talking Island. Now I sail on a ship to <a link="farbo2">the north</a>.<br>
It seems that even more people came here after it was turned to ruins. I mean, it's almost like they think there's something special to see here or something.

But I wish that people thought more of those of us that live here. They are just so greedy...
