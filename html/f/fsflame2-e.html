<p>
<p>Yes! Yes! Excellent choice. Keh... Keh... Keh...
<br>
<p>The <a link="fsflame3">Summoner of Blood,</a> my master, has spoken.
<p>One who knows not anger in this world is not worth his existence.
<br>
<p>Do you desire to feel the powerful seduction of wrath? Yes, I will show you how great it can be.
<br>
<p>It' the force that can draw out the tremendous dormant power in the depths of your soul.
<br>
<p>Get angry. Make sure to remember clearly those who made you angry and burn them with your wrath. Do this so that they will also become furious at you... and pass on the wrath.
<p>And be angry at the world that made you like this. Shower the entire world with your fury... and the world will be yours.
<p>If you don't completely understand all this at the moment, don't be too concerned.  Kek... kek... I will be behind you.
<p>I will become your blood... flesh... and your soul.
<br>
<p>Now, I have an important task of darkness for you.
<br>
<p>Recently among the evils in Aden, there are some demons and devils that have been provoking my anger.
<p>Perhaps you've heard of them. They are Demon, and his devils Baphomet and Beleth.
<p>They've always despised us undead types and treat us with nothing but disrespect.
<p>I'd like you to destroy them.
<p>Although this task may seem a little daunting, you should never step back, even if you fail.
<br>
<p>If you truly want to work with me, you'll have to give me a small sacrifice.
<p>I'd like you to offer a part of your soul to me. Compared to the reward I'll give you, it is an insignificant price!
<br>
<p>If you can bring me back proof that you've rid the land of those fiends, along with the token of your sacrifice, I'll allow you to use the items they possessed.
<p>What do you say? Can you think of a better offer? Heh Heh Heh
