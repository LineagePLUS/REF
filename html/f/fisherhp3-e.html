<p>You have the right to collect taxes from the people of this territory. At the same time, it is your duty to pay tribute to the king, Ken Rauhel.
<p>You have the right to adjust the tax rate of this region. This rate is applied to the villages near the Heine Castle and will affect the prices of all the products traded there.
<p>If you decide on a taxation rate, my lord, the rate will be effective beginning with the next day's collection. In cases where you change the taxation rate several times a day, the last rate set during the day will be applied as the next day's taxation rate.
<p>The tax collected on one day will arrive at the castle by dawn of the next.<br>
<p>All the tax money collected belongs to you. However, do not spend it all. You need to present a certain amount to the king -- and then there are maintenance costs required to keep the castle running.<br>
<p>Of course, if you increase the tax rate, the castle treasury will grow richer; but if you raise the rates too high, you will face resistance from the territory inhabitants. Please consider these points carefully when deciding on your taxation rate.
