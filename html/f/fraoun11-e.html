<p>The last item I wish to explain to you concerns meat. Even if your capabilities are great, you cannot endure hunger. Meat is just the thing to ease this suffering.
<br>
<p>The most important thing you need to remember is that in order to <font fg=ffffff>shout</font> so that all the people can hear you, not just the ones close by, you should have sufficient strength from having eaten enough. As you continue to shout, your hunger returns and eventually you reach a state where you cannot shout. Try eating meat just then. OK?
<br>
<p>Another pointer, besides just nourishing yourself, meat can also be used in order to <font fg=ffffff>tame animals</font>. You may have seen other people going about with their pets by their side. Those people have made pets of the animals by taming them with meat.
