<p>Hmm, let me think. An adventurer with good weapons and armor - I don't think there is a need for anything else. Do you? If the weapon is good, then can't any enemy be beaten? If the shield is good, then aren't you protected from any enemy attack? Do not be fooled by such presumptuous thinking. No matter how good the weapon is, there will always be an even stronger enemy. And no matter how good the shield is, there will come a day when you are wounded. At such times, you will find that a potion could make the difference between living and dying.

<p>There are many kinds of potions, the most common are the healing varieties but you'll find others to be beneficial as well.  Some potions such as cure poison allow you to recover from a poisonous attack. Others, such as haste, bestow additional powers to enhance your abilities. Don't forget that it's best to be prepared. How does one use the potion?  Quite simple, just <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> on the potion to drink it.
