<p>Please feel free to look around. Do you need anything in particular? It is foolish to depend solely on equipment, but even more foolish to ignore such matters altogether. Being prepared with balanced equipment that suits one's abilities and using it appropriately is certainly one of the ways to become a skilled adventurer. You should concern yourself with everything -- from the various items such as <a link="fraoun8"> weapons</a>, <a link="fraoun9">armor</a> and <a link="fraoun10">potions</a> to food.
