<p>You dare ask me about the Summoner of Blood, the ruler of the evil race?!!
<br>
<p>Since you will show me your good faith today... I will tell you. He is truly a prominent and mighty being in this world.
<br>
<p>I'm sure you already know that in the beginning of the world there existed two beings, Einhasad and Gran Kain.
<p>These two beings alone were not that significant... but they had five children, Shilen, Maphr, Paagrio, Sayha and Eva.
<br>
<p>Among them, Shilen was the strongest. Even after 10,000 years had passed, the other children could not even come close to Shilen in her greatness.
<p>Einhasad became jealous of Shilen and committed the foolish act of banishing Shilen from their world.
<p>Shilen became incensed with her banishment and out of her deep-seated rage, she created a new type of being -- our race, the race of evil creatures.
<br>
<p>Among the creatures of the evil race, the being that reflects Shilen's deep-seated anger the most is our master, the Summoner of Blood.
<br>
<p>Although a worthless creature like you could never understand, a great change occurred in our world after the Summoner of Blood made his appearance.
<p>He united the forces of evil creatures who had been acting individually without guidance. He broke the seal that had been imposed on us and resurrected the slain evil creatures to become the undead.
<p>I was one of the resurrected... by his own hands.
<p>I will always adore him and worship him.
<p>I was ripped apart by Elves but he restored me… I'll never forget his kind act. He means the world to me.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether you will ever be granted with the honor... But if you sincerely desire and worship him always, some day, he may appear to you.
