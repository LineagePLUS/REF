<p>Weapons are important to everyone. Even a Wizard, who devotes his entire life to sorcery, cannot solve everything in this world with magic alone. It is an unequivocal fact that a weapon is the most important piece of equipment for any adventurer. Perhaps that is why everyone is always seeking to upgrade their weapon.
<br>
<p>But even when you have a superb weapon, unless you equip yourself with it, the tool is of absolutely no value against any opponent what-so-ever. To arm yourself with the weapon, simply <font fg=ffffff>double-click</font> the desired item from the Item Window. Do the same when removing the weapon. One thing you should take notice of is that there are two types of weapons: the ones you can hold with one hand and the kind that require both hands to grasp. <font fg=ffffff>Be advised that when you use a two-handed weapon, you will not be able to hold a shield at the same time</font>.
