<p>You want to know how to give an item to someone else? That is even easier than buying or selling items -- so simple that the concept of explaining the procedure almost seems silly! But since you ask, I guess I have no other choice than to explain, huh? Of course you will need to open the Item Window by pressing the <fg=ffffff>Tab</font> key. Drag the items you choose, or the appropriate adena, and release them onto the other person and you are finished.
<br>
<p>One thing you may want to keep in mind is that for items such as adena that can be counted, you must define the quantity to hand over. And you should stand close enough to the other person so that you can hand over or receive the items easily. Well, does this answer your question?
