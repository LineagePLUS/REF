<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Grand Chamberlain Fisher:</p></font>
<br>
<p>Your majesty <var src="#0">, you are the lord of this castle. And I have overseen the castle and the feudal territory as the Grand Chamberlain since the days of old, when this place was called Gludio Castle. I am proud to say that I know more about this castle and the territory than anyone else.
<p>Since I first became the grand chamberlain many have reigned as the lord of this castle. But no matter whom the lord is, I have loyally served the castle and the territory.
<p>My loyalties remain with no one specific person, but rather with the lord of the Heine Territory. As long as you remain the lord of this territory, I will remain your faithful servant.
<p>You will collect taxes from the region through me, hire mercenaries with the money collected, and have the greatest power in the region. But please do not squander the money; think of your people in the territory and rule the land wisely.
<p>I say my final words out of elderly concern. As the lord of this region, you will always remain in this world. Even when leave this world, your avatar will remain and accept all challenges to your authority. So, please do not wander outside the castle unprepared. When you need to leave, always travel to safe places, as you never know where your enemies are lying and waiting to end your life.
