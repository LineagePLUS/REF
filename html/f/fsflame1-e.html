<p>Grunt. Grunt... You came all the way here… to find me. This tells me that your mind must have been already infused with the energy of "darkness."
<p>Accepting a new energy into yourself is like starting a new life. The "darkness" will give unto you a "newness."
<br>
<p>You may have heard worthless creatures, such as Humans, talk adversely about the darkness. But they are ignorant fools.
<p>Unless there was "darkness," the energy of "light" would never have come to exist.
<p>The energy of light exists because the energy of darkness exists. As much as light is sacred, so is darkness.
<p>Even the Elves, said to be the children of light, ended up being engulfed by darkness and have fallen. Darkness is not a bad thing. Heh heh heh.
<br>
<p>Give careful consideration to what I'm about to tell you. What drove you all the way here?
<p>Could it be your desire for darkness?
<br>
<p>Always remember that you can obtain tremendous power through me.
<p>Also bear in mind that nobody in this world is interested in a worthless creature like yourself.
<br>
<p>Kek... kek... I see that your soul has not stripped itself of its doubts.
<br>
<p>You have taken an arduous journey to come here. You have just arrived and are you already giving up? How can you give up so readily without discovering the result of your efforts?<p>If you have run all the way here with a certain purpose, don't you have to open the door and find out what is waiting for you on the other side?
<br>
<p>Hmm...
<p>In the event that you have ignored my words or listened to me half-heartedly, you will surely regret it later.
<p>Don't provoke me. If you make me angry, I will shred your body and feast on your soul for lunch. And... I will slaughter all living beings who are of any relation to you. Heh Heh Heh.
