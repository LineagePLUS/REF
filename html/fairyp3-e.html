<p>Hello, I am the Fairy Princess and am following the orders of the Mother of the Forest and Elves to observe Darkmar. But... actually, I'm really lonely... Other Elves run around and play in the Elven Forest, listen to old stories told by the guardians and eat the delicious fruit given by ents... So, what good is this life for me? I just follow Darkmar around every day... And I was even given this task because of abilities I received as a blessing... It's nice to be able to do something for the Elven Forest... but, it seems like there's nothing I can do about my loneliness. Still, I will persevere and carry out my work diligently in order to become a great fairy like my mother, the Fairy Queen.
