Long ago, at the time this fortress was built, I was sent here from the Silent Cavern. I moved in and have been watching over it ever since. 
<br>
I can tell you what you need to know in order to protect the fortress.
<br>
Diad Fortress was built as a line of defense, protecting against one route of invasion into Aden. 
<br>
Inside the fortress, the agricultural area forms a barrier, as well as the entrance to a cave. In the cave you will find the items that form the basis of the Dark Elven economy.
<br>
Past this defensive wall you will find a path that takes you to Lastabad Castle, the capital city of the Dark Elves. It is guarded by moving food items in order to prevent those who are not Dark Elves from passing.
<br>
<br>
Now the most important part...
<br>
Because Diad Fortress is situated at the gateway to Lastabad Castle, the Dark Elven army will continuously attempt to conquer the fortress.
<p>The Dark Elves typically put their two leaders called Baranka and Laia out front. Killing them is the only sure way to protect the fortress.
