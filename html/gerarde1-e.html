<p>Hmm... You are an Elf, a descendant of elementals. I didn't think that I would see one of your race here, considering that you're usually not interested in the human world. In fact, I've only seen one Elf before - that was when I was serving the king.</p>
<br>
<p>The Elf's name was Zillian the Moon Knight. But whatever other people think, I can't regard him as a Knight. A Knight without a lord is preposterous, because royalty and courage are basic principles of Knights.</p>
<br>
<p>That's why I don't like you so much. Whatever happens in the world, you Elves just remain inside your quiet little nest. Even now, when the Pretender King's tyranny is getting worse, the Elven Forest keeps itself in silence.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyway, if you are looking for human help, you will find good people among the Knights here. But if you just came here thinking of traipsing your little way through the forest, I suggest you to go back immediately - the human world is not as easy as your forest.</p>
