<P>My one true success thus far has been instilling a cursed spellbook with magical power.  It’s most useful as it adds protection for we Wizards who have chosen the rewards of an intellectual career over, shall we say, a more primal or physical one.</p>
<P>If you would like this book of magical powers, bring me a cursed spellbook and a skeleton skull and I will bestow magical power to the cursed spellbook.</p>
<P>Skeleton skulls can be obtained from skeletons in the dungeon to the northwest of here. Skeletons, as ghouls, are a kind of undead monster, and can be brought down easily if you employ turn undead or healing magic.</p>
