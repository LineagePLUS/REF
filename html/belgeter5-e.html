<p>The "party" concept you are asking me about is a little bit more complex than other issues, so please listen carefully.
<br>
<p>As you continue your adventures, you will meet many obstacles that you cannot overcome by yourself. Even if you find that you can win by yourself, the task is more fun and effective if you join your efforts with those of other people in a cooperative union.
<br>
<p>If there is someone that you would like to adventure together with, all you have to do is move in front of and face him or her, and then type <font fg=ffffff>/invite</font>. If the other person also wishes for your company and agrees to your offer, the two of you can form a party and fight together. In such cases, the person who offered the invitation becomes the party leader and has several important rights over the party. For example, only the leader can invite someone else as a party member. 
<br>
<p>In contrast to an invitation, the leader can also banish a useless member from the party. When the leader says <font fg=ffffff>/ban [character's name]</font>, the person exits the party and returns to his/her own adventure again. Of course, a member is free to exit the party by typing <font fg=ffffff>/leave party</font>.
<br>
<p>A party can have a maximum of eight people and party members have the advantage of being able to check each other's physical constitutions at all times. The experience acquired by tackling a monster is shared equally among party members as well. They say a picture is worth a thousand words; you'll be able to find out directly when you form a party yourself.
