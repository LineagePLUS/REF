<p>Do you have a friend with whom you can share your deepest, darkest secrets? If you are alone now, it is likely that you'll be alone later, too. When someone has an ambitious spirit they often think they can do everything alone, never needing to rely on anyone else. However, you are human and are getting older. As you age, it only natural that you'll become feeble. No one in this world remains powerful forever. Don't forget that a true friend is one who will take care of you when you are old and weak and who will ease your loneliness.
