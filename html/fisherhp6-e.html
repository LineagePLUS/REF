<p>As you have recently done, my lord, there are many groups outside striving to win this castle. In order to remain the lord of this castle, you must confront these threats wisely.
<p>Now that you have the castle in your hands, you must first adjust the tax rate in order to get funds to fix the castle gates which were damaged in battle. Once the money is available, you must repair the inner and outer castle gates so that the enemies can't lurk around. Mercenaries should be hired in order to strengthen your military power within the castle.
<p>Many other Blood Pledges will challenge you once you win the castle. Sieges begin at a time you decide, my lord. After taking the castle, please let me know when the next siege will take place. You can alter the date within half a day after taking over the castle; once this period has passed, you cannot change the date. If you do not set a date for the next siege battle, the next siege is automatically set for ten days later.
<p>When the siege begins, you must defend the castle until sunset of that day. Even if you lose the castle temporarily during the day, should you win it back by sunset, the castle will continue to be yours, my lord. Then you will decide the time for the next siege battle.
<br>
<p>After the war begins, it would be best to keep the enemies out of the outer castle gates. The outer gates are strong and, as you can place archers on the castle walls, it will be very advantageous for you. But you cannot keep the castle gates closed forever -- and it would be dangerous to assume that enemies will attack only from outside of the outer gates. In such cases, even though they are not as strong, the inner gates act as a second castle barrier.
<p>No one can assure you that the catastrophe of the inner gates being destroyed will never happen. My lord, therefore you should always keep a sufficient number of bodyguards by your side.
<p>The most important condition for protecting the castle is that your enemies not take the crown within the inner castle. If the lord of the enemy Blood Pledge takes the crown, then you will also lose the battle. 
<p>The crown is guarded by the Suho Tap so you should put top priority on protecting the Suho Tap.
<p>Forgive me for my words, but the end for the loser is tragic. Please take wise actions, my lord.
