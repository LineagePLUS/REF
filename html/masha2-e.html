<P>Since long ago, in Aden, there has existed an Emblem of the Royal Family that was passed down from generation to generation within the royal family.</p> 
<P>It is rumored that the Emblem was destroyed by the Pretender King and disappeared.  However, it is my understanding that this is not the case and someone knows where it is located.  </p> 
<P>Apparently, only a very small number of people connected to the inner circle of the old Aden have information about the Emblem. </p> 
<P>The old Emblem of the Royal Family is a symbol of the conviction of us who are resisting the forces of the Pretender King. If you can find this Emblem and bring it back to me, I'll take you to meet Duke Digardeng.</p>
