<p>You're one of the new kids that Bludika is training, eh?</p>
<p>You know, I've seen countless folks like you come through here and I'm not particularly glad to see you and there's certainly no reason for me to trust you just because you're training under a master.</p>
<p>Someday you'll understand that yourself. I was also raised like you by Bludika to be expendable but it looks like you're still useful to him.</p>
<br>
<p>I know that you have come to me to get my help.</p>
<br>
<p>But, regardless of the task that your master has given you, I can't just help you without proper payment.</p>
<br> <br> <a link="kimaq2">I will pay any price.</a></font>
