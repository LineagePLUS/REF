Just as before, the vast forces of Lastabad have gathered outside, hoping to capture the fortress. If you are to hold on to it, you must deal wisely with these threats.
<br>
<br>
After taking the fortress, you will be challenged by the Lastabad Blood Pledge. The siege of this Blood Pledge will take place at the time scheduled for the enemy's attack and will be decided by you. After taking the castle, please tell me when you wish to fight the enemy again. You may change this time until one half day has passed following the taking of the fortress. After that you cannot change the siege time again. If you have not made prepared to protect the fortress by this time, the forces of Lastabad will attack suddenly approximately ten days later.
<br>Once the siege starts, my Lord, you must defend the agricultural areas until the sun sets that day. If the castle is taken from you by the Lastabad army, then the fortress will be immediately transferred to them and the siege will automatically be terminated. You must never let this happen.
<br><br>
I don't want to unneccessarily alarm you, but failure in this task would have far-reaching and tragic consequences. Do not fail!
