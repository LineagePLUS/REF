<p>The Northern Forest belonged to the orc tribes in the past. Originally there were dozens of small and large <a link="lyra6">tribes</a>, but about ten years ago, one-eyed Seghem, the chief of the Atuba tribe, started conquering other tribes and now 'tis one big tribal community.
<p>He is greatly worried about the fact that their Northern Forest home is disappearing to the humans, and 'tis why there is a constant struggle between humans and orcs in the forest. But the people here are also the victims of the war, it is only <a link="lyra8">the orcs that are gaining benefits</a> from the chaos brought by the war.
