<P>Have you also come from a far away land to fight the evil forces of the Pretender King?  If so, I would like to tell you a few special points you must take to heart as a Prince/Princess.</p>
<P>1. Always puts honor above wealth.</p>
<P>2. Value the members of your Blood Pledge more than yourself.</p>
<P>3. Radiate dignity in all actions and refrain from acting frivolously.</p>
<P>4. Know the significance of velvet softness and iron strength.</p>
<P>5. Be willing to sacrifice yourself in the face of danger to save the other members of your Blood Pledge.</p>
<P>Lastly, remember at all times that one word from you can lead the loyal members of your Blood Pledge, who trust and follow you, to either death or glory.</p>
