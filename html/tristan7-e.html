I don't have any fighting responsibilities but I do take pride in my work. I am surprised that you aren't killing me... seeing as how I'm defenseless and all... But don't think this makes me feel beholden to you!  No, I wouldn't defile myself!

This is a just war. I would just as soon kill you as look at you.
