<p>In the past, the guardians and rangers would receive help from the Fairy Princess to find and chase Darkmar out of his den... But every time they did that, he came back shortly thereafter and started his research again. Darkmar, it seems, has created a duplicate den, just like the first, in order to conceal himself and to make it that much more difficult for us to find him. To access that den, you will need the help of the Fairy Princess who has the ability to find the Light of Darkness. Because Darkmar moves his den so often, the Fairy Princess may not always be able to tell you where he is in the Elven Forest.  But if you persevere in your search, I'm confident that you'll succeed. And bring me the Cursed Spirit Scroll that he has taken.
