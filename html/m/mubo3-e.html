<p>I am not sure if you are aware of this fact, but some monsters have a strong affinity to each other. For this reason, some people face situations they could not expect.
<p>I will give you an example. If you were to attack an Orc or a Kobold, all the members of the same tribe--in this case, all the other Orcs and Kobolds--in the area will recognize you as an enemy and will all attack you at once.
<p>Also, when you attack a werewolf, different species like dogs or wolves might attack you as well. If you wish to become an expert hunter, you must understand the characteristics of all these monsters thoroughly. Always keep these facts in your mind and look around for other monsters in the nearby area.
<p>Oh! And among those nasty flying monsters, there are those that come down to land only if they drop something on the ground and others that dive down to the ground to attack any person they see.
