<br>
I will give you three main tasks. The three tasks include work related to us Humans, work connected to the Elves and work related to the Dark Elves. The peace of Aden is not something just for us Humans to work on alone. As I've previously mentioned, this task related to other races, too.
<br>
The task for us Humans is to bring back the coins of Aden. These coins were minted in order to provide military funding for the Aden Knights but an unknown creature absconded with them when they were being transported.
You must meet with the person who was in charge of transporting the coins of Aden, investigate the facts of their disappearence and recover them. If you do that, you'll have completed one of the three tasks entrusted to you.
<br>
The second task, which involves the Elves, is to recover the water of life. Recently, there have been  problems with the guardians who watch over the Elven Forest. Their basic function is to attack and expulse creatures that invade the Elven Forest or threaten the lives of Elves but suddenly they are acting as though they've lost this basic instinct.
<br>
Investigations indicate that this is related to a problem with the water of life that the guardians use. And so I need you to investigate this situation and bring back the water of life.
<br>
And lastly is the most sensitive of the three tasks, bringing back the luminous stone of the Dark Elves. The Dark Elves, with whom we previously had good relations with, are now refusing to participate in the Aden Knights and won't interact with us in any capacity. 
<br>
According to my sources, the Dark Elves believe that their stone was damaged by a Human. So we need you to investigate this and bring back the luminous stone which will give us difinitive answers to this mystery.
<br>
You should keep in mind that due to the threat posed by the creatures of Jejeo, the ones who will give you help can only be seen on certain days and at certain times. The transporter who will help you can only be seen beginning on February 4, 2004 at 10am in the time of your world. The guardian who will give you help will only be seen beginning on February 11, 2004 at 10am in the time of your world. Kahn's Guard who will give you help can only be seen beginning on February 18, 2004 at 10am in the time of your world.
<br>
<p>If you complete all three tasks and provide the evidence that you received from them and also deliver the evidence achieved in the <a link="montes5">real world</a>, then I will give you the evidence that will prove that you are an Aden Knight. Please complete the three tasks so that you can bring peace to Aden.
