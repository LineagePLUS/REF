<p>Me? I'm learning weaving techniques from the arachnes nowadays...
Arachnes are quite something. Of course <a link="morienE2">Nerupa</a>, who
makes everything, is great...but watching the other arachnes move their eight
hands to produce <a link="morienE3">webs</a> and <a link="morienE4">threads</a> is amazing!
<br>
Unlike our soft skins, their hard <a link="morienE5">shells</a> can
reflect most spears and swords. Could there be more perfect beings than
arachnes?
