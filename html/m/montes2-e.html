<br>
As you well know, peace came to Aden with the destruction of the pretender-king Ken Rauhel. But the ominous feeling that peace can't last long is becoming stronger.  Evil is as plentiful in the replacement forces of Ken Rauhel as it was when the pretender-king himself was here. This may be reason enough to rally forces and fight but I think our biggest problem is something called the Shadow of Jejeo.
<br>
The new king of Aden created a group, united in righteousness, in order to prepare for the next battle and he named it the Aden Knights. The peace of Aden is not just a task to be handled by humans alone but by all those who inhabit Aden. It is a crucial task and the peace of Aden and its citizens depend on its success.
<br>
If you are interested in making a difference and would like to participate in the realization of righteousness, then I would like to entrust you with several tasks.
