<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Mother of the Forest and Elves:</p></font>

<p>This is a sacred place for Elves; as a rule, you can't enter here. A rule is a rule, but the result is the result. What can I do to one who has already entered here?</p>
<p>This is a different world from the one in which you live. Though it may be little dangerous for you, I hope you have a safe journey.</p>
