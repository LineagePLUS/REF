<br>
The real world is a world that moves according to laws that are different than here. The laws of that world are profound like the dispersion of blood falling into water. The truths of this place may or may not work there. Rather than expressing with words, it would be better for you to feel it directly in person.
<br>
The bestowing of evidence from the real world as a task for joining the Aden Knights is something that requires the discernment of a person who has experienced the value of a good code of ethics to make a difference in the world.
<br>
Anyway, the real world moves according to laws that are different and the Aden Knights are waiting for those having the enlightenment of that world.
