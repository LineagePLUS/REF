Actually, I have a pretty good idea of the kind of person you are -- you see,  your reputation preceeds you. I understand that you are someone from a different world who has come here to take a bit of rest in this world where I live. I've heard that the time in the world in which you live is six times slower than it is here. Am I right?

According to my creators, you are the one that can set right the values system of this world that has gone wrong. My creators have asked me a question recently, "Montes, new creatures will soon show their faces in the world in which you live. What plan do you have to deal with that?"

<p>My creators have requested to interact with you too. If you would like to share your opinions with them, you can contact them at develop@lineage.co.kr.
