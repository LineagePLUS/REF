Magic dice were developed at the Ivory Tower as a magical tool for fortune telling. There are two kinds of magic dice around now.
<p>There are the four-sided dice showing the directions of north, south, east and west and the six-sided dice that randomly have the numbers one through six.</p>
<p>As a basic prerequiste to using the magic dice, you'll need to have magic stones.</p>
<p>One magic stone is consumed each time you use the dice.</p>
