<p>As you know, the Dark Elven army of Lastabad has finally invaded Aden.
<p>For now, with the help of many support troops, our forces are prevailing over them. It seems they have increasing numbers of injured soldiers and deserters. I'm sure you must have seen the fearsome prowess they exhibited when they were acting as a well organized force. When they are dispersed, however, they are not so powerful. Of course we're not home free yet.
<p>I think we should take advantage of the momentum we have right now and crush the morale of their troops.
<p>So, we the guardians of Aden want you to destroy the Lastabad army and bring back a badge as proof.
<p>If you ask Eno standing over there, he will explain the details to you.
<br>
<p>Also, if you obtain the medals of our soldiers who fought in the war, try taking them to the cathedral...
