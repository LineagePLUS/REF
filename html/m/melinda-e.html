<p>Hush! Come quietly and I shall tell you of Elindare...
<br>
<p>Rumors tell that she once studied under Desperion upon the shores of Talking Island. But her lust for power was too strong and she broke away from her teacher. 
<br>
<p>I've heard that she has formed an alliance with the anti-king, but who knows? None have entered her castle lair and lived to tell tales to the likes of me.
