<p>The current state of the world is the indirect result of many disturbed sovereigns and their improper actions. 
Thanks to these fool sovereigns, the Kingdom of Aden has endured great injure.

<p>If you still have not met the strategist Zero, take a boat from the wharf on the eastern end of this island and go to the town of Kent in Gludio Territory. That should be your first step.</p>
<p>If, however, you have already met Zero, go to the dungeon on the western end of this island. If you bring me back a spell scroll with the secret of life, taken from a stone golem, I will bestow you with the magical power you require as a sovereign.</p>
