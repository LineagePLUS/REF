<font fg=ffffff><p align=center>Hints &amp; Tips: Wizards</p></font>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Background:</font>
<p>The Wizard is a character of holy order who understands all principles of the world in the context of the conflict between Einhasad and Gran Kain. Wizards are more interested in the understanding and emulation of the power arising from this cosmic truth, than on religious faith in either of the two gods and therefore are not considered pure members of the clergy.</p>
<p>
The alignment of a Wizard, having deep ties with the gods, has a great influence on the magic he or she practices. Even though the alignment of individual Wizards may vary from one to another, Wizards can be divided into two broad groups: 1) White Wizards who respect the teachings of Einhasad and use their magic for the common good and 2) Black Wizards who follow Gran Kain's wishes and spread evil.

<font fg=ffffaf>Starting location:</font>
<p>Wizards have poor combat skills and no spells at the beginning, they are most effective with high Wisdom and Intelligence, (which affect mana) so it is best to distribute a good portion of character points between these two traits when creating the character.  Wizards start the game on Singing Island, a new player zone where they may acquire experience, garner helpful advice from NPCs, and learn the basics of trading/buying and combat before venturing further.  Singing Island is also where a Wizard may purchase the first two levels of spells. They can learn their 1st group of spells at level 4 from NPC Siriss. Wizards can learn the next group of magic spells every 4 levels that they advance. A character can remain on Singing Island until they reach level 10.</p>
<br><font fg=ffffaf>The initial stage of the game:</font><p>On Singing Island, there is a training ground for practicing combat in order to gain levels. Once level 4 is attained, a Wizard should be able to hunt various lower level monsters on the Island whose defeat will offer materials and adena. Basic items can be bought and sold from NPC Johan.  There are also numerous "healers" who will heal a character for free when one's HP becomes low.  NPC Ishtar will teleport players to The Talking Island when they are ready to go out into the world.  </p><br><font fg=ffffaf>Basic equipment:</font><p>All Wizards start the game with a leather jacket, two candles and a dagger.  One can arm/turn on/wear the dagger, candles and jacket by double-clicking each in the inventory window (accessible by pressing the Tab key or clicking the bag icon<img src="#29">.)</p><p>A new Wizard will have NO magic and must first increase levels on the training ground.  Since the Wizard's constitution and HP will be low in the beginning, it is of utmost importance to acquire first level (Light, Shield, Energy Bolt, Heal, etc.) spells as quickly as possible. Seek out NPC Siriss for initial magic. </p><p>Magic and counsel can also be obtained from NPC Gereng on Talking Island in exchange for adena. 
As a Wizard advances, he or she will obtain spells from spellbooks and magic stones dropped by various monsters.
</p><br><font fg=ffffaf>Basic Terms of Magic:</font><p> Magic Bonus: The magic bonus increases power of the spell (it increases damage inflicted or success probability). This number usually depends on the caster's intelligence. There are some items that can raise the magic bonus.</p><p>
Magic Power (Spell Power): This is the Spell Level + Magic Bonus which shows the net power of caster's spell. You can check this number at the Magic Window.</p><p>
Magic Resistance(MR): Magic Resistance gives you the power to resist harmful spells and also reduces the damage inflicted on you by magic. Basically, it depends on the level and wisdom. There are also items that can raise the magic resistance.</p><p>
Magic Type: There are 8 types of spells: Heal, Bestow, Attack, Life, Death, Control, Curse, Transform. Some items raise one specific type of magic, or negate it. There are also monsters who are more or less resistant to a specific type of magic.</p><p>
Attribute of Magic: Some spells have one of four attributes (fire, earth, air, water). The power of magic increases if used on the monster with the opposite attribute, but decreases if the attribute is the same. Player characters can also have a specific attribute by using special items.</p><p>
Alignment of Magic: Each spell belongs to one of three alignments (lawful, neutral, chaotic). Each spell can affect the caster's alignment also. And some spells gain more power as the caster's alignment gets closer to them.</p><p>
Beam Magic: Some spells shoot a beam from the caster. These are called Beam Magic, and only some items (i.e. Shield of Reflection) can affect this type of spell.</p><p>
Target of Magic: Every spell has its own possible target. If you don't specify the correct target, the spell doesn't work: </p><p>
- Caster: It only affects the caster. You don't have to specify the target. </p><p>
- PC: It only affects the player character in the screen. </p><p>
- NPC: It only affects the monsters in the screen. </p><p>
- Pledge: It only affects the player character whose Blood Pledge is the same as caster. </p><p>
- Enemy: It affects the monsters or the members of the Blood Pledge that is at war with the caster's pledge</p><p>
