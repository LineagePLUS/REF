<p>Arachnes are spider like creatures with eight legs behind their backs.
When Einhasad was creating the Elves, She infused life force to the spiders
around the World Tree to aid Her; they are usually calm and cold but they like Elves very much...
so much that they are always willing to give useful materials like ecdyses and threads to us.
Threads are usually used for bows, clothes, cloaks, and other miscellaneous items, while ecdyses are useful for armor or shields.
You should ask Morien for more information on these materials; she is learning how to weave from the arachnes.
Arachnes are not just weavers; they possess the ability to make various items and their elder, <a link="hurinE8">Nerupa</a>, makes all kind of things for us.
