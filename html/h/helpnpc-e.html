<font fg=ffffff><p align=center>Command Help: NPC Control</p></font>
<br>
<p>PCs can control NPCs in three ways. Those methods are as follows.
<br><br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Contracting with Mercenaries:</font>
<p>Mercenaries can be hired if a castle is captured. If a player clicks on one of the hired mercenaries, the following commands can be given to the entire unit.<br>
<br>
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Aggressive State</p></font>
<p>The mercenary unit follows the owner around and attacks what the owner attacks and targets that attack it.
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Defensive State</p></font>
<p>The mercenary unit follows the owner around and attacks only targets that attack it.
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Rest</p></font>
<p>The mercenary unit does not move from the place which was ordered. In this state, the mercenary unit only attacks targets that attack it.
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Deploy</p></font>
<p>The mercenary unit creates a widely spread formation which is centered around the owner. 
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Alert</p></font>
<p>The mercenary unit does not move from the place which was ordered. In this state, the mercenary unit attacks, within a certain range, targets that attack it and members of Blood Pledges that are enemies of the Blood Pledge of the owner.
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Dismiss</p></font>
<p>Dismisses the mercenary unit. In the same way as some monsters, a mercenary unit that has been dismissed cannot be controlled again so one should be adequately careful before giving this order.
<br><br>
<font fg=eeeeae>Controlling monsters with magic:</font>
<p>Enemy monsters can be controlled for a certain period of time by using the 5th Level Spell: Tame Monster. Commands that can be given to controlled monsters are the same as those given to mercenaries.
<br><br>
<font fg=eeeeae>Taming Animals:</font>
<p>Certain animals, such as wolves, can be tamed by feeding them food. These animals can be tamed more easily when they are weak than when they are healthy.
<p>The food that is used to tame them can differ between them so you should try various foods.
<p>Different than NPCs that are controlled using the two methods above, tamed animals fight together with their owners and so can gain experience points and raise their levels. Of course, the higher their levels increase, the stronger the animals become and so, depending on the animal, it is possible for special abilities to be developed.
<p>Tamed animals must be fed regularly. If an owner does not feed his pet, even when the owner is starving, the pet may abandon its owner. Normally, the effect of meat given to a wolf lasts about one day in the game.
<p>A tamed animal is automatically left at the pet kennel when its owner leaves the game. Tamed animals can be left and retrieved at the pet kennel and as long as it is in such a location, it will not starve. There is a pet kennel in each village.
<br>
<p>The following special commands can be given only to a tamed monster:
<br>
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Designate Attack Target</p></font>
<p>The monster attacks a specific monster or PC designated by its owner.
<font fg=ffff0f><p>Gather</p></font>
<p>While following its owner around, a monster picks up items nearby and gives them to its owner. The higher a monster's level, the further away the items are that it can gather.
