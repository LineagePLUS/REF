<p>An animal tournament decides a champion from among eight animals. The game will begin if you register your animal by paying the entry fee and then wait for the challenger(s).</p>
<p>The game advances automatically from the quarterfinals to the finals. You can give your animal items or cast spells before the game, but you can't aid your critter during the game.</p>
<br>
<p>The winner and loser of the final match will get the eight people's entry fees, dividing them 3:1.
<p>You don't have to enter the animal tournament -- you can also predict the winner and bet your money. Part of this bet will go to the champion as a prize.</p>
