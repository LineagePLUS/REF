Have you heard of Lake Louis? I caution you to stay off of <font fg=ffffff>Losus Island</font> there. They say that due to the fog and rocks around the lake, the island is a haven for wild animals and monsters. Supposedly, an abundance criminals have escaped to that island too. Can you imagine the dangers that lurk there? I have no cause to go to this island, so it does not matter to me, but just the thought of the place sends goose bumps down my spine.
