<p>Fairies are creatures with small bodies and shiny wings -- but don't be fooled by their short stature, they are quite powerful magicians. When Einhasad was creating Elves, She infused a wind elemental into a butterfly to create the first fairy.  Only the fairies know how to purify rough mithril.  Also, you can make the bodies of swords by coating mithril on their wings....but you'd better ask Doett about mithril coating because he is the expert on such things.
