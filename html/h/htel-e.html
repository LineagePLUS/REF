<p>Ah ha!  You came to talk to me.  You must feel confident in your ability.  I guess this means that you no longer need the training here in this valley?  Very well.  Are you ready for this?  Are you ready to venture into a world where, unlike this place, no one will protect you.  It's a world that is rough and evil but vast and warm at the same time.
<br>
<p>But, by any chance, if you end up feeling that you need more training, then ask Drist and come back here.  I believe you have the ability to tell the difference between courage and recklessness.
