<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Spells Window:</font>
<p>You can press <font fg=ffffff>Ctrl-S</font> anytime to bring up the Spells Window.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Teleport Bookmarking:</font>
<p>You can teleport to a place you've been before using the Scroll of Teleportation and the magic item Teleport Control Ring.	</p>
<p>If you input <font=ffffff>"/bookmark [name of place to bookmark]"</font> into the chat input window, your current location is bookmarked. Then, equipped with the Transport Control Ring, if you use the Scroll of Teleportation, the location names bookmarked with the above method are displayed. Double-click on the location name where you want to go and you will be teleported there.</p>
<p>If you just input <font fg=fffff>"/bookmark"</font> you can see the list of locations which you have bookmarked.</p>
<p>To erase a bookmarked location, press the <font fg=ffffff>Delete key </font>after clicking the locations to delete from the list.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Spell Shortcut Keys:</font>
<p>In the same way as with items, you can also assign spells to the F5 - F12 keys by inputting <font fg=ffffff>"/F(5 - 12) [name of assigned spell]"</font> Also, shortcut keys can be assigned by opening the spells window and <font=ffffff>dragging a spell icon</font> to the location of the respective key in the Shortcut Key Window at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Switching to Spell Mode:</font>
<p>You can switch to spell mode by pressing <font fg=ffffff>Ctrl-X.</font> During spell mode, the most recent spell used is displayed on the left side of the bottom row of the screen. You can use that spell automatically on  a designated target. However, since there are no previously used spells when first starting the game, no spells are remembered. If you press Ctrl-X again, the spell mode is terminated and ordinary attack is possible.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Forced Spell Attack:</font>
<p>In the same way as with common attacks, spells basically can only be used on PCs when the Ctrl key is pressed. </p>
