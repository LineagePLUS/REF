<p>Ents are the spirits of trees Einhasad made as She was creating the Elves; She infused the treespirits with the power to walk.  You'll have to look closely, however - when ents aren't choosing to move around, they look very like normal trees.  Twigs and bark of ent are essential -- we have grown to depend on them. I'd suggest asking Theodor about the way to collect things from ents. He may have many strange ideas, but he does understand entkind very well.
