<p>Our mistress <a link="helpdog3">Lyra</a> has big ideas of a small self-supporting farming community, run on nothing but faith. Bah!
<p>I hate it. I want a better life...good food, good clothes! It's all a lie that we can be satisfied with that shabby lifestyle.
<br>
<p>It's impossible now, because we have nothing, but someday... I'll earn money and I'll <a link="helpdog4">do something</a>!
