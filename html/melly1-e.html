<p>I've got something fun to tell you. Do you know about the <a link="melly2">Tower of Insolence</a>?<br>
It is said to be a tower built by some king who tried to challenge the gods long ago. Reaching all the way to the clouds, this symbol of such arrogance is supposedly a tower of 100 stories!
And the immortal wizards and dark sages say that some really scary monsters are sealed within.<br><br>
And so recently, many youngsters that cannot restrain their curiosity are venturing inside and losing their lives. Boo hoo...<br>
Do you also want to go? That tower is said to stand at the base of the Twilight Mountains. Yes, the Twilight Mountains are where those terrible giants roam.
