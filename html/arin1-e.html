<p>Do you know that when we talk about giants, we are usually referring to those gargantuan monsters found in the Twilight Mountains?
<p>They, however, were not the original ancient giants. According to myth, the ancient giants were humans that had attained such a high level that they could actually alter the physical laws of nature.  With their magical and physical powers, their race flourished into an incredible civilization.
<p>Of course the evolution of their existence is only a myth and the giants of today can do nothing but intimidate us with their humongous size.
