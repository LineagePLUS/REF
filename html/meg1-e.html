<P>Once in a while, I think of the Prince I used to serve.  He always thought of his Blood Pledge members before himself.  The irreplaceable times I spent with him were the most precious of my life.  </p> 
<P>But there is someone who completely wiped out my happy existence -- the Pretender King.  Whenever I hear that name, my blood boils and my eyes fill with rage.  He destroyed and robbed me of everything that was precious to me.  He's not human... No, he's a devil!  Because of him, many people have spilled their blood and lost loved ones.
