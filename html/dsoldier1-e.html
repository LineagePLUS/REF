<p>Hey! Do you have it? The stuff...
<p>I'm talking about the stuff that Master Montes used to test you guys.
<p>If you have it, why don't you give it to me? I'll compensate you generously.
<p>What? You'll give it to me only if I exchange it with adena? Listen, if you keep money now, you will end up losing a big chunk of it to pay taxes! It's not worth it!
<p>Rather than getting worthless adena, you'd be much better off with this Dark Elf badge I'm holding in my hand!
<p>So, if you have the stuff, let me take a look at it. Come on! If you continue to hold onto them, they won't do you any good. Trust me!
