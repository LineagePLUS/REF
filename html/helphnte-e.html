<font fg=ffffff><p align=center>Hints &amp; Tips: Elf</p></font>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Setting:</font>
<p>Elves start in the Elven Forest, which lies at the center-western part of the Kingdom of Aden. As avatars of nature, they tend to avoid contact with humans.  However, they do often interact with humans to protect them according to the teachings of Einhasad and/or to befriend them.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Starting location:</font>
<p>All Elves start in the Elven Village to the east of the Orcish Fortress and north of Castle Kent. The Elven Forest is the forest around the Mother of the Forest and Elves, one of the first life forms created by Einhasad. This forest is protected by Elves and four guardian races (arachne, pan, fairy, ent), and is thus one of the few places where humans are not allowed.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>The initial stage of the game:</font>
<p>There is no concept of money in the Elven Forest - Elves have to make their items themselves. Elves gather materials from the Elven Forest, the Cave of The Sleeping Dragon, and the guardians, and make items from these materials. The materials Elves can get from the four guardian races (and how to get them) are as follows:</p>
<p>Arachne: Arachnes give webs and all kind of threads. To get webs, attack the arachne with your bare hands after feeding them a few twigs of ent.</p>
<p>Pan: These give pan's mane and all kind of plates. To get the manes, you must attack it with your hand.  If you use a weapon, it will attack you. </p>
<p>Fairy: Faries give pure mithril and oriharukon. If you get rough mithril from the Cave of the Sleeping Dragon and give it to fairies, they will refine it to pure mithril.</p>
<p>Ent: These will give twigs of ent and bark of ent. To get twigs, you just have to attack an ent, but to get the bark of ent you have to attack it after feeding the ent with fungus juice to reduce the hold of the bark.</p>
<p>Besides those listed, there are other materials...talk to NPCs in the Elven Forest, and they may help you find them.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Basic equipment:</font>
<p>All Elves start the game with a short bow, wooden jacket, and 100 arrows. You can wield/wear the short bow and jacket by double-clicking each in the inventory window (accessible by pressing the Tab key or clicking the bag icon<img src="#29">.)</p>
<p>Thanks to their keen senses, Elves have infravision when in caves, enabling greater sight than that of humans.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>NPCs whom Elves may find interesting:</font>
<p> Mother of the Forest and Elves: the big tree at the center of the village, and the first Elf contained within the tree. She can tell first-born Elves their fate, and knows the way of life.</p>
<p> Nerupa: An elder of the arachnes who lives in the cave beside the Mother of the Forest and Elves. She makes items for Elves from the materials they collect.</p>
<p> Horun: A young apprentice of Hardin living in a magical research center at the entrance of Dragon Valley, east of the Elven Forest. He can give detailed explanations about the entkind, and teaches Elves spells up to level three.</p>
<p> Doett: An NPC in the Elven town with extensive knowledge about mithril and fairies.</p>
<p> Hurindalien: An NPC in the Elven town, who knows a lot about the four guardian races.</p>
<p> Narhen: The best musician among Elves, with great knowledge of pans.</p>
<br>
<font fg=ffffaf>Places Elves may find interesting:</font>
<p> Mother of the Forest and Elves: One of the first life forms Einhasad created, this is the center of elemental activities. If Elves stay around the tree, they heal faster. There is a big tree in the Elven Village and three more trees rooted around the Elven Forest.</p>
<p> Cave of the Sleeping Dragon: A dungeon located at the border of the Elven Forest and the Orcish Fortress. You can get rough mithril from the monsters here, and there is an earth dragon living in the fourth floor.</p>
