<P>I came here with Sabin, a white Wizard, to find materials needed in my research on souls.</p> 
<P>The fruit of our laborious research, the Crystal of Soul, was taken by the Ice Queen. It has the power to, not only, put a raging dragon to sleep but also undo the curse magic of Kerenis, the black Wizard.</p> 
<P>In the past, people came here seeking to undo Kerenis's curse, however, since this magic requires immense sacrifice - a person with a pure soul, the sacrifice of an elf who is a descendent of the Spirit of the Forest and the sacrifice of a white Wizard - all who tried, abandoned the effort.  </p> 
<P>They are afraid of sacrificing themselves... But they are selfish individuals. The act of sacrificing one's self for another is something that will make your soul shine brightly. Each living organism has only one life to live. Everything that happens in one's life is recorded not only while the being is alive, but even after its death, the record remains in the Document of Soul that the being possesses. In other words, the series of events and actions occurring during a living being's life are recorded in a space called time.  </p> 
<P>If you don't understand my words, blame your own dull-headedness. </p>
