<br>Silver is more valuable than copper, my friend. 
<br>With luck, you might even get a gold seal! Without it, you might get nothing. 
<br>But you're not unlucky, are you?
<br>
<br>Some people are such sore losers!
<br>
<br>I accept accept copper, silver and gold seals. 
<br>A gold seal will get you a scroll, a ring and an amulet. That should make you feel better! 
<br>What do you say?
<br>
<br>If this doesn't interest you, you may want to talk to my brother Kwanil down there.
