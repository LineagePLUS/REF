<p>For my Ivory Tower graduate studies, I am learning how to put a shield of magical protection over armor to make it stronger. Currently, I am working on an Iron Skin that can be used even at the lower levels. If you wish, I would be happy to cover your armor with an Iron Skin. But you must give me 200 adenas to pay for the magical ingredients that go into the procedure.
