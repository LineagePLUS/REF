What gives the Dark Elves the right to control us?
<br>
According to the Elder, we were once enslaved by a tribe called the Giants. He says that the Dark Elves were our friends back then.
<br>
My, how times have changed. Now we are slaves. As much as I hate to admit it, I think we will need to rise against them soon.
<br>
I wish the Giants would return and destroy the Dark Elves!
