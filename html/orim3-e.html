<p>I am conducting many experiments, but none have proven practical or profitable. I am especially interested in the properties of light -- the seen and the unseen, the reflections and absence of light. 'Tis why I was called The Shadow by my colleagues at the Ivory Tower.
<p>These days I am applying my experiments in many parts of this ruined complex. Just simple tricks, but they hide me from my ex-companion's eyes. Search as hard as they may, I doubt they can find the path leading to this place.
