<p>Don't you think the girls working in the Pledge House are really pretty? I like that kind of modest woman...ha, ha, ha. I mean, if I just had some money, I would prepare that kind of house. Whew...<br>
These days, even the Dark Elven girls seem to be charming. <br><br>
From what I've heard, the Dark Elven army invaded from underground this time. Do you suppose a Dark Elven city could be found under there if I went and looked hard enough.<br>
And then I'd even be able to meet lots of pretty Dark Elven girls too!
