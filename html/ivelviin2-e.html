<p>As I mentioned, the main component of the sword is Oriharukon. To tell you the truth, though I can make it, the opulence of the material amazes even me. 
<p>If you wish me to make the sword again despite this, bring me the following ingredients.
<p>Get 500 Oriharukons, five each of the highest quality diamond, emerald, sapphire and ruby -- and 30 ashes of Astagio which you can obtain near that volcano. If you bring me all this, I will take a hammer into my hand once more.
