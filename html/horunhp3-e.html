<p>There are a total of ten levels of magic: first level magic is mostly simple cantrips such as creating light or healing minor wounds.  As you examine higher-level spells, you will find them to be far more powerful -- but those spells are not for everyone. Seventh level or higher spells, for instance, can be learned only by professional Wizards. Elves are very good at magic naturally, so they can learn spells up to level six, while a Prince or Princess (who should know a little bit about everything) can only learn up to level two.</p>
<p>There is also a difference in speed of acquisition:  Wizards learn the first level of spells at level four and get an opportunity to learn the next level spells every four levels thereafter. Elves can learn their first level spells at level eight and move up every eight levels. Princes and Princesses learn the first level spells at level ten, and their only other level of spells at level 20.</p>
<p>All I, or any other Wizard, can teach you are the spells at the third level or less.  Spells of fourth or higher level can't be taught, per se -- you must find a spellbook during your adventuring and read it...but if the spell is lawful or chaotic, you will find it to be unintelligble unless you take it to an appropriately aligned temple.
