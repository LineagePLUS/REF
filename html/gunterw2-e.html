<p>Two gods, Einhasad and Gran Kain, represent the good and the evil of the world...there will always be a struggle amongst the two, as long as humankind exists on this land.
<p>Many people say that we are now in the age of Gran Kain: the continuous invasion wars of the Pretender King, growing fear amongst the people, the absence of security ...'tis sad indeed.  Even on our island, many youths carry out deeds of evil impetuously, without hesitation... 'Tis shameful, yet it is reality.
