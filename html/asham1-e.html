Those who are here didn't just come on their own free will. We were forced to this place because of the arrogance of our elders.<br>
In fact, my wife is a big fan of Elder Bludika... and so I ended up here by following her. But I prefer the prosperous capital city to this country village.

<p>Since this war started there, I think that we won't be able to see Lastabad again. It seems that the Elder is trying to join forces with them and make our race think again about what is important.<br>
No, no. On second thought, perhaps this will give me an opportunity to go back to that place.
It would be so nice to see my hometown Lastabad again.<br><br>
If you'd like to hear some more detailed stories about the war, please go check with Elder Bludika.
