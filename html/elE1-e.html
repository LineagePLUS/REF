Remember to accumulate not just wealth, but also compassion...
<br>

This is the communal storage for Elves. You can put anything here,
but you won't find it again outside of the forest.
I heard that there are other storage repositories run by dwarves. 
<br>
Hah!  I wish I were playing in the forest and traveling the world... but I can't even move
due to my responsibility as a storage keeper...'tis a sad thing, being pinned here like a dwarf.
<br>
Unfortunately, even though it's communal I still have to be paid - I'll
collect two pure mithrils when you retrieve your items.
