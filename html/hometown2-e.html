<p>The money received from the village will be allocated in proportion to how much you have contributed during the recent set time period.
<p>Higher compensation will be given to those who protect the village by killing evil monsters than to those who seek sanctuary through quiet meditation. 
<br>But the level of contribution is not simply a measure of the number of monsters killed, location and risk also are important factors. Adventurers who endure the peril of going into a dangerous dungeon to fight monsters, rather than comparatively safe open fields, will see greater levels of reward.
<p>In fact, the selection of mayor is also based on this level of contribution. So, if you want to become mayor, it would be wise to put forth some additional effort. As mayor, you're responsible for deciding the tax rates which are divided among the citizens and have an effect on the amount of support funds that go around. The mayor, of course,  receives a level of compensation that is much greater than that given to ordinary citizens.
