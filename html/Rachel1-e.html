<br>Hello <username>.
<br>
Would you like to know about armor?
<br><br>
<p>Go to Jane, the leather craftsman who works near the northern gate of Singing Island. You should take her seven furs.
<br>If you need furs, you should hunt deer or Kobolds--they often have fur.
<br>When you have the furs, talk to Jane. Click on <font fg=ffffff>leather shield</font> in the item list. Click on <font fg=ffffff>Request leather shield.</font>
<br>Open your item window. Locate your shield. Double-click on it to wear, or wield it. Look at your Armor Class. Did it go down by one number? Remember, a lower AC is better.
<br>
The more useful the item you wish to make, the more complex the ingredient list to make it gets.
<br><br>
Alternatively, you may receive weapons or armor from monsters that you kill which are better than the armor or weaponry you currently possess.
