<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Alchemist Ryumiel:</p></font> <br> A shining belt of body... First, we've got to have an old belt of body. And... what else is there?... Oh... right...<br>I'll need 30 high quality rubies. And you need to get 50 shining scales from Ramia.<br> The catalyst for refining gems is very expensive and so the charge for my services is 100,000 adena. You might think this is too expensive but I'm actually doing it for you at a cheap price. The shining belt of body that I'm making for you is small because of the spiral structure of the magic but it will be helpful to you in recovering physical strength. <br> <br> <a action="request bright belt of body">Make shining belt of body.</a><br>
