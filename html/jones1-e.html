<p>I was once an adventure-seeking warrior, much like you are.
<p>Rather than carry a sword in its sheath on my back, I spent more time holding it firmly in both hands. And instead of armor that shone with a silvery gleam, more often than not it was stained red from the blood of my enemies. 
<p>I gave up those ways because of my experience in the Tower of Insolence. Yeah, as the name suggests, it takes pure arrogance to even approach the Tower and I was brimming with it.
<p>I challenged the Tower of Insolence without a sword and without even knowing how high was the sky or how wide was the earth. I was so reckless as to imagine that there weren't any monsters I could not overcome.
<p>... I had never known fear, even in places like Dragon Valley. It was in the Tower of Insolence where I first experienced the agony of sheer terror. Incredibly powerful monsters appeared before me against which I was powerless, I lost my leg as payment for learning simple humility. Now, thanks to lots of therapy and some much needed wisdom, I don't seek to defy death and conquer all in my path.
<p>Bravery and courage, or confidence and arrogance... they cannot be easily distinguished sometimes. Mark my words, young warrior, they may save you some day.
