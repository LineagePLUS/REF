<p>Hello there! Did you come from Oren perchance?
<p>If you did, perhaps you saw the great clouded area called the Scar of Lindvior on your way here? I don't think you could have missed it.
<p>The land was dreadfully stricken about ten years ago and the wind dragon Lindvior's imprint is forever apparent from when he, blinded with rage, descended upon Aden to attack the castle. That is how the valley was formed right next to the castle.
<p>No one knows why Lindvior was so angry, although it is rumored that the Witch Kerenis did something horrible to him.
<p>Lindvior is said to be weaker than the fire dragon Valakas, the most powerful of all dragons, but still extremely dangerous. 
<p>In that attack, one third of Aden's population was wiped out. That attack still haunts some of the older folk around here.
<p>Since that battle, nobody has seen any trace of Lindvior again but... I suspect he'll make another appearance.
