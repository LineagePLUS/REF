<p>People tell stories that the Ice Queen lives below the Glacial Lake and is as beautiful, cruel, and heartless as ice. The rumor has it that the abnormally cold climate of Oren is the result of the cold air she breathes out.
<p>But I heard from a scholar I met once before that the stories are only partially true. The real cause of the cold is the collision reaction of cold air from the Ice Queen and the hot air from Valakas inhabiting the lair of the Fire Dragon nearby. 
<p>At first, I was sure it was just another funny theory. But now that I've thought it over, the story seems quite plausible. If not, how could two areas immediately adjacent to each other be the coldest and the hottest in Aden at the same time? Don't you agree?
