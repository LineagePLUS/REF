<p>The bark of the entkind also has various uses. <a link="theodorE4">Nerupa</a> can use them to make boots, shields or armor. Also, if you feed them to <a link="theodorE5">arachnes</a>, you can get something from them. Don't you think Einhasad was clever when She made the guardians?
<br>To get bark from an ent, you have to hit them...but I heard that you should apply fungus juice first or the bark won't slip off easily.</p>
