<p>It is a real honor to see the shadow race of Elves here.<br>
Is it true that the first flames of this war started in Lastabad, which is your home? I heard that the names of the scrolls there are Sing, Grave and Dantes, right?<br><br>
Sing, Grave... grave of the stars... I'm personally very curious why the one that watches over the grave of the stars in the dark underground would have come to play this overture of destruction. I'm wondering if it's the greed that wanted to make the stars themselves into graves.
