<p>Are you one that pursues light and darkness and is of the Dark Elven Assassins Guild that is called the traitors of Lastabad?!<br>
Welcome! While it is true that your Lastabad tribe has brought about this war, aren't you still the ones in which light and darkness exist together? As a representative of the Humans, I really respect that deeply.<br>
The gods repeat the processes of creation and destruction. Who knows if perhaps this world has passed through the period of creation and has now reached a time of destruction?<br>
