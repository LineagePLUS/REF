<p>Oh dear, I wonder why an honorable Knight seeks my help?  The harder I think, the more certain I am that I have nothing to teach you. I am allowed to teach only the simplest sort of magic. As long as you have your sharp weapon and thick coat of armor, I don't think you will need any magic. Do you?
