<BR>
<p> A Pledge house is one of the houses in a town which can be owned by a Blood Pledge. Only rulers who have Blood Pledges at <font fg=ffffff>level 15 or above </font>may acquire a Pledge house. Blood Pledges who already own a castle may not also own a Pledge house. <BR> If a member of a Blood Pledge which has a Pledge house is killed in the game, he starts again from his Blood Pledge's Pledge house. When a member uses teleportation, he or she is returned to the Pledge house rather than a village nearby. As with inns, the recovery rates for HPs and MPs inside of a Pledge house are faster than normal. <BR> Since a Pledge house is a place owned by the Prince or Princess of the area, <font fg=ffffff>tax</font> must be paid regularly in order to continue using the Pledge house. Taxes are paid through the servant of the house. In addition, various orders may be given through the servant regarding the management of the house. <BR> On the <font fg=ffffff>auction bulletin board</font> there is a list of Pledge houses that are not currently owned. Persons  wishing to buy a Pledge house must participate in an auction through the auction bulletin board. <BR>
