<p>I am Aria, daughter of the elder of Woodbec. Thank you so much for saying that you'll help our town. 
<p>The ants that invade our town live in the ant tunnels in the desert. It is said that there within those dark tunnels lives the Mutant Giant Ant Queen who controls the actions of all the other ants. In my humble opinion, the best method would be to drive that Mutant Giant Ant Queen from the desert. So, I'll wait for good news from you about the citizens of our town and my own father who have all been taken away.
