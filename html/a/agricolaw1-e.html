<p>As part of my graduation program from the Ivory Tower, I am working on methods of enhancing the strength of weapons by using magic. I am still a beginner and have not gone beyond the Enchant Weapon level yet. But if you wish, I could put an Enchant Weapon spell on your weapon. You will need to pay me a fee of 200 adena for the magical ingredients.
