<br>
<p>This is the dueling field. You can fight both monsters and other adventurers here. The area within the field boundaries is the only <font fg=ffffff>area where aggressive behavior is allowed to take place between adventurers.</font> Please let me know if you still wish to enter. But remember, I take no responsibility for any unfortunate accidents that may arise once you go inside. Be careful.
