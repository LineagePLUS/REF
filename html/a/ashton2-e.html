<p>We burn the fields to make the barren soil more productive. We don't usually do that because the profit is quite low, especially compared to the amount of work involved. But since there is no field to work on, what choice do we have?  The Northern Forest is dangerous because of the large Orc tribes, and this place is no different - but I've heard that many people moved to the Northen Forest and built a new village.
