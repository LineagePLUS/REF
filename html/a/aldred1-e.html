<p> I am the gardener. All the flower gardens in this town and in the castle are maintained by me. Hey, it looks really nice, doesn't it? One automatically feels good when looking at beautiful flowers. <br><br>
I sure hope the tides of war don't cover over this beautiful place. I've heard a rumor that the Dark Elven army has completely ruined Gludin Village...<br>
I heard that, because of this, an Aden protection force has been formed to go up against them and fight. I just wish that everyone would bring this war to an end without trouble.
