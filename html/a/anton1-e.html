<p>Umm... Don't bother me. I am working on a project right now. In a little while, I'll finish up the best work of art I've ever made in my whole life.<br><br>
As I've heard from the rumors, the Dark Elven army has invaded the south and everybody is shaking with fear. In such an important time as this, I'm really resentful of the gods.<br>
I'm not sure what it is exactly, but some Aden protection force has apparently been formed to stop them and that comforts me a bit.
