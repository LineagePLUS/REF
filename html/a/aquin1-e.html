<p>My parents say that we gypsies are different from ordinary people, that is why we don't live quietly in one place but instead wander all over.
<p>Unfortunately, because of our wanderings, we don't have many friends and this lifestyle is hard on everyone. We'd all be a lot more comfortable if we could have just one home base... but apparently other people do not like living among us.
<p>The Pretender King said that moving around like this in the past was fun and not at all uncomfortable for him. I don't know who the Pretender King thinks he is but, if you ask me, he must have a screw loose.
