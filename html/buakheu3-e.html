There was a time when this was home to a flourishing water city called Eva's Kingdom, a city Eva ordered her subjects to build. When Eva was looking for a kingdom to demonstrate her authority, she discovered this place. Her subordinates were ordered to construct a great city at the bottom of the lake. Buildings in the shape of water drops were built here and there. Lights in all the colors of the rainbow shined in this city and Eva created a <a link="buakheu4">magical boundary of water</a> around the city to protect it from any kind of corrupt and polluted existence. The entrance leading to the surface was a very complex maze and this prevented land attackers from entering Eva's Kingdom. The subterranean water path you came by is the maze I am talking about -- but now monsters inhabit the path leading to the surface.</p>
