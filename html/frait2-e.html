<p>Ok, you wish to participate in the event? But you have to understand that this event is not all fun and games. Your abilities and courage will be tested together.</p>
<p>AYou have to begin collecting proofs of courage. How do you do this? It's simple. You get them after beating monsters!</p>
<p>There are fourteen types of monsters that have the proofs of courage. Dwarves, werewolves and giant spiders are the easiest to beat. But it's difficult to get the proofs of courage from these monsters.</p>
<p>If you wish to confront a stronger set of monsters, try the ghoul, scorpion, bugbear, ungoliant, cerberus, vakuuk, ramia, shark and crabman.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can take a shot at the dark elf and king bugbear but they are very strong, so you have to watch out. On the other hand, these monsters are more likely to give up proofs of courage.</p>
<p>Now, which event do you wish to participate in?</p>
