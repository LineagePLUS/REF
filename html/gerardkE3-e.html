<p>The Potion of Revival is something very precious that is given only to a true Red Knight. This potion is used to recover the true mind of a Red Knight after one's soul has been tarnished by the forces of the Pretender King - which is something that can indeed happen. Because it is so strong that it can even release the curse of the evil god Gran Kain, keep in mind that only one of these is given to each person.
