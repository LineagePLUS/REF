<p>We recognize you as a true Red Knight. Also, your name will be recorded in the history books of the Red Knights. 
<p>Starting with me and extending to the invincible Gunter of Talking Island, Ricky and Aanon of Silver Knight Town, Peddler Mark of the desert and Jim of Gludio Dungeon... we have all tested your nature as a Red Knight. You have passed the loyalty test of Gunter, Ricky and Aanon and the sacrifice test of Mark and Jim. Finally, you have passed the weakness test given by me. 
<p>A Knight must know how to maintain faithfulness and to sacrifice himself but more than anything, he must know how weak of a being he is. Also, as you have risen to a place of respect by the many Red Knight aspirants, you must take yet more care in your actions. 
<p>Now that you have passed all the tests of the Red Knight, go and meet the Duke of Digardeng who is a pillar of Werlden Village where the Dragon Valakas lurks. May the blessings of Einhasad be with you...
