<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Gunter:</p></font>
<br>
<p>Our present state is the result of countless malevolent Princes.  Even the Kingdom of Aden is suffering because of this situation.</p>
<p>If you have not yet met with the tactician Zero, take a ship from the eastern dock and seek him out in the town of Kent in Gludio Territory.</p>
<p>If, however, you've already met with him, go to the dungeon on the western part of this island. There, you'll need to snatch from a golem the spellbook in which is written the secret of life. Bring that to me and I will bestow you with magic you'll need as a Prince.</p>
