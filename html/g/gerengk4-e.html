<p>Oren is a small mountainous country located in the northern region of the continent. Its territory is very small, but Oren has produced many gifted scholars.
<p>The Wizard's academy at Oren is acknowledged to be the best institution of magical learning, and is called the Ivory Tower.  Try visiting it sometime, when you travel the main continent. Then of course, magic might be a boring subject for you.
