You've reached quite a milestone! At level 6 you become accountable for your own well-being.
<br><br>
Previously, there was no penalty for dying. However, at level 6 and above you will actually lose experience when you die. You also have the possibility of dropping to a previous level if you have less than 1% experience.
<br><br>
Right now, you'll notice that your total Hit Points and Mana Points increase each time you increase your level. This will allow you to fight stronger opponents.
