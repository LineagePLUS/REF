<font fg=ffffff><p align=left>Head of Mercenary Squad Ian:</p></font> <br> I was lucky enough to live through the previous attack of the Dark Elves.<br>The Dark Elven army that I saw on that day was horrific. Who here could have foreseen that they would attack so suddenly and in such an organized manner?<br> They used wild beasts just as if they were their own hands and feet. Creatures like black spirits attacked Humans indiscriminantly. If you had seen that nightmarish war, you would have wanted to run away no matter how brave a person you were.<br> Right now it's quiet for a moment but that is just because they need time to re-equip their army. Anyway, I'm worried about how things will turn out in the future. <br>Unless everyone in our land works together, I really think they will be difficult for us to get rid of.
