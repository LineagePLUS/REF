<p>Welcome, sorcerer. Having met Wizards like you before, I have a question to ask of you: Do you serve the good god Einhasad, or the evil god Gran Kain?</p>
<br>
<p>If you are serving Einhasad, you should work to aid the Knights who aim to defeat the Pretender King. Good Wizards have always been the trustworthy allies of Knights... But if you are serving Gran Kain, I cannot forgive you. I'm sure that Ken Rauhel, the Pretender King, used black magic to deceive Queen Gadria. It seems certain that the Pretender King has the forces of a powerful black Wizard at his disposal...</p>
