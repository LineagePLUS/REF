<p>Hardin - a blood brother of Duke Dephil, the former king of Aden. No other person on the continent is more knowledgeable about the principles of good and evil.
<p>He was a benefactor of Gunter, the master of the House of the Red Knight. They say Gunter learned of this island from Hardin.
<p>In fact, supposedly before Gunter, no swordsman ever set foot on this island.  However, thanks to his training ground, many such as yourself call this island their home. Quite interesting, hmm?
