<p>I was thinking... today would be a good opportunity to test your ability as a Red Knight. Do you know about the Arachnevil Elder that lives in southern region of the island?  Sure, you've probably killed a few of these when fighting in a group but have you ever killed one by yourself?  Kill an Arachnevil Elder alone and bring me its Arachnevil Elder's Claw as proof.  This is the test that I bestow on you.
