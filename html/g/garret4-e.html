Curious about zones? You may have noticed the message 'Safety Zone' appearing wherever you travel on this island.  Zones are divided among three types:</p>
<p>Safety Zone<br>
When you are in a safety zone, you may not be attacked by other players.<br>
Normal Zone<br>
If you die in a normal zone, you will lose experience, items, and alignment as per normal game rules. On PvP servers, you may be attacked by other players in normal zones. These zones account for most of the areas of Lineage.<br>
Combat Zone<br>
If you are killed by another player in a combat zone, it will not result in experience, item, or alignment loss. Regardless of server type, you may be attacked by other players in a combat zone.  These zones are generally found near town gates or building doorways.</p>
