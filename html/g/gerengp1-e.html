<p>You are of Duke Dephil's blood? Hahaha...hmm, well, you may be telling the truth, stranger things have happened in these chaotic times. 
<p>But the former king has passed away, and <a  link=gerengp2>the former king's Blood Pledges</a> have all died or are missing. Now the only one who can prove that you are of Duke Dephil's blood would be <a link=gerengp3>Queen Gadria</a> at Aden Castle...To prove your lineage, you must travel to Aden.
