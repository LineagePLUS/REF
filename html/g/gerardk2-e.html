<p>Your eyes say that you want to be stronger...but shining armor and a skill with swords doesn't make one a true Knight.</p>
<br>
<p>Protecting the <a link="gerardk3">lord</a> at the critical moment with his own shield, and defending his honor while risking of all his blood...  That's the spirit of a true Knight! Only the one with the right spirit truly deserves the title.
