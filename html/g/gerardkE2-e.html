<p>There is a training passageway on the other side of the bow practice range that is guarded by three of my Oren underlings. Go into that passageway and kill the Ramia. Then, get the Ramia room key and use it to go into the room where the Ramia Chief is confined. Kill the Ramia Chief and bring me the Ramia's Scale as proof. The Ramia is a monster that would normally be no match for you but this is made more difficult in that you cannot take much with you into the passageway. The only items that can be used are a Red Knight's sword and Cure Poison Potion. Also, a poisonous gas is given off there and so time is not on your side. A Knight cannot solely rely on good weapons and so when - and only when - you realize your weakness and overcome it, will you receive the title of a true Red Knight. At that time you will be awarded the Potion of Revival which is given only to a true Red Knight.
