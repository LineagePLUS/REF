<p>That you have come to this place means you have already heard of <a link="gunterp4">the House of the Red Knight</a>, correct?</p>
<p>I have spent many years training young and foolish lads such as you to become honorable Knights...I can read a youngster's heart like a book.</P>
<p>You are not the sort of person who is satisfied to work beneath another, are you?  You were born to be a leader!</p>
