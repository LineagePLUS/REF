<p>Hmm...I never thought I would meet an Elf in such a forlorn place... where chaos abounds. Looking for something interesting, eh? Well... even though this is a remote place, it is rumored to have been a training ground for <a link="gerenge2">Wizards</a> since long ago.  Many <a link="gerenge3">ingredients</a> needed for magic are to be found here and the local <a link="gerenge4">spirits</a> are very active, as well.  Quite a bit to draw you, I suppose!
