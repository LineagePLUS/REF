<p>Are you saying that you are from the royal blood who ran from the Pretender King's tyranny? Well, it looks like you have certain power to attract other people that is natural among noble bloods. But I've seen so many false Princes and Princesses who claim to be royal bloods during the numerous wars. So I can't trust you so easily.</p>
<br>
<p>The true king will claim his rightful place by himself. If you can prove that you are the true king by deposing the Pretender King, who took the throne by deceiving the innocent Queen Gadria, then I'll pledge my loyalty to you.</p>
<br>
<p>If you came here to search for allies who will shed blood to defeat the Pretender King, you made a wise decision. Here, there are many reliable young Knights who want to share your dreams. I can guarantee the ones upon whom I bestowed knighthood with my honor. You can distinguish them easily because all of them will carry the Shield of Red Knight as proof of the training they went through here.</p>
