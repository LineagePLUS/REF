<p>The Potion of Revival is something that is used only if and when it is needed. If such a situation occurs, know that you will not be able to use the Potion of Revival by yourself if you have already have changed to the dark side. In other words, your compatriot will have to use their own potion in order to save you. The Potion of Revival is an item that represents the unavoidable need of deep friendship in life and in this world that surpasses even the bonds of death.
