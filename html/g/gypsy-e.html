I'm a magician learning the skill of shape changing. For a small contribution of 20 adena, I will cast a spell that will temporarily shape change you into a creature of your choice. The enchantment will only last 30 minutes.
<br><br>You'll also take on the attributes of the creature you become-becoming faster or stronger depending on type. Choose wisely! Some monsters have disadvantages as well. They may be slower, incapable of wearing armor, or wielding certain weapons.
