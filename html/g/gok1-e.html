I've waited a long time. Please don't ask me anything about my true character but I will tell you how the situation developed.
<br>
I'm sure you know that we Dark Elves, who have experience dealing with Humans, have expressed our opinion about not participating in the Aden Knights. But there has actually been a big misunderstanding about this.
<br>
OK, let me give you the low-down on what's really happened. Recently, there have been problems with the Stone of Ideology, which is crucial to the existence of us Dark Elves. Upon investigation we've discovered that the Stone of Ideology was damaged by Humans. I'm sure you realize that the results of the investigation are a hoax but Bludika has said that we cannot interact with humans anymore because of that incident.
<br>
I have done a lot of looking into this situation and I've found that the damage to the Stone of Ideology was not caused by a human but by the Creature of Jejeo. However, I don't have enough evidence to prove that based on the investigation results alone. So... I would like you to provide some support to the results of my investigation by bringing me a Piece of Luminous Rock that can prove matters conclusively.
<br>
I repeat, you mustn't ask who I am or about my true character. I can only hope that the trust between us Dark Elves and Humans can be restored based on your acts of righteousness.
<br>
As the fate of this world depends on successful execution of this task that you've been entrusted with, I ask you to hurry and carry it out. Remember we are counting on you to prevail.
