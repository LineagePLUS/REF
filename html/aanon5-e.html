<p>Did Ricky send you?  I see that you are wearing a hood that you got from him.</p>
<p>If you'll bring me an old trading document and the shell of a turtle dragon, I'll demonstrate a technique that will make your hood a bit stronger.</p>
<p>I understand that a turtle dragon resides on the east side of this village. Be careful, though, there have been sightings of poisonous Ramia in the area and they will chase you on sight!</p>
