<br>
After we Oums are born, the Dark Elves give us food to eat and a place to sleep.
<br>
And once we get big, then they make us work.
<br>
Sometimes, Oums with really large bodies are dragged off to the mineral mine.
<br>
I wasn't taken to the mineral mine but according to Oums who have escaped... the only thing to do there is to mine for purple rocks.
<br>
If an Oum mines a lot of the purple rocks, then he is given a lot to eat. If he doesn't mine much then he isn't given much to eat either.
<br>
Therefore, a lot of Oums have starved to death or gotten sick and died from working there.
