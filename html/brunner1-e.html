<p>Welcome! I'm Brunner, the the mayor of this town. As you can see, this is but a poor village on a wasteland that is not good for farming and is full of frightful monsters. 
<br><br>
The people here are supporting their lives by catching fish from the sea and raising crops from our small fields. And it would become very desolate indeed if most of our earnings were taken in taxes.<br>
But because of this war, the young people of the village are being recruited away. Nearby Gludin Village has been completely destroyed... These are really terrible days...
</p>
<br>
<p>
I wonder if the current usurper knows how bad things are. If <a link="brunner2">Karel Tanford</a>, who built Windawood with his own hand, were to find this out, his rest in the world beyond would be troubled indeed...
